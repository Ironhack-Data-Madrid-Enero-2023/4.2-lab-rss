A layperson, an entry-level developer, or even someone who hires developers will tell you that job is to … well … <em>write software.</em> Pretty simple.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An experienced practitioner will tell you something very different. They&#8217;d say that the job <em>involves</em> writing some software, sure. But deep down it&#8217;s about the <em>purpose</em> of software. Figuring out what kinds of problems are amenable to automation through code. Knowing what to build, and sometimes what not to build because it won&#8217;t provide value.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>They may even summarize it as: &#8220;my job is to spot <code>for()</code> loops and <code>if/then</code> statements in the wild.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I, thankfully, learned this early in my career, at a time when I could still refer to myself as a software developer. Companies build or buy software to automate human labor, allowing them to eliminate existing jobs or help teams to accomplish more. So it behooves a software developer to spot what portions of human activity can be properly automated away through code, and then build <em>that</em>. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This mindset has followed me into my work in ML/AI.&nbsp;Because if companies use code to automate business rules, they use ML/AI to automate decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given that, what would you say is the job of a data scientist (or ML engineer, or any other such title)?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;ll share my answer in a bit. But first, let&#8217;s talk about the typical ML workflow.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Building Models</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A common task for a data scientist is to build a predictive model. You know the drill: pull some data, carve it up into features, feed it into one of scikit-learn&#8217;s various algorithms. The first go-round never produces a great result, though. (If it does, you suspect that the variable you&#8217;re trying to predict has mixed in with the variables used to predict it. This is what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;feature leak.&#8221;) So now you tweak the classifier&#8217;s parameters and try again, in search of improved performance. You&#8217;ll try this with a few other algorithms, and their respective tuning parameters–maybe even break out TensorFlow to build a custom neural net along the way–and the winning model will be the one that heads to production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You might say that the outcome of this exercise is a performant predictive model. That&#8217;s sort of true. But like the question about the role of the software developer, there&#8217;s more to see here. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Collectively, your attempts teach you about your data and its relation to the problem you&#8217;re trying to solve. Think about what the model results tell you: &#8220;Maybe a random forest isn&#8217;t the best tool to split this data, but XLNet is.&#8221;&nbsp;If <em>none</em> of your models performed well, that tells you that your dataset–your choice of raw data, feature selection, and feature engineering–is not amenable to machine learning. Perhaps you need a different raw dataset from which to start. Or the necessary features simply aren&#8217;t available in any data you&#8217;ve collected, because this problem requires the kind of nuance that comes with a long career history in this problem domain. I&#8217;ve found this learning to be a valuable, though often understated and underappreciated, aspect of developing ML models.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, this exercise in model-building was … rather tedious? I&#8217;d file it under &#8220;dull, repetitive, and predictable,&#8221; which are my three cues that it&#8217;s time to automate a task.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Dull:</strong> You&#8217;re not here for the model itself; you&#8217;re after the results. How well did it perform? What does that teach me about my data?</li><li><strong>Repetitive:</strong> You&#8217;re trying several algorithms, but doing roughly the same thing each time.</li><li><strong>Predictable:</strong> The scikit-learn classifiers share a similar interface, so you can invoke the same <code>train()</code> call on each one while passing in the same training dataset. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yes, this calls for a <code>for()</code> loop. And data scientists who came from a software development background have written similar loops over the years. Eventually they stumble across <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GridSearchCV</a>, which accepts a set of algorithms and parameter combinations to try. The path is the same either way: setup, start job, walk away.&nbsp;Get your results in a few hours.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Building a Better for() loop for ML</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of this leads us to automated machine learning, or autoML. There are various implementations–from the industrial-grade AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SageMaker Autopilot</a> and Google Cloud <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vertex AI</a>, to offerings from smaller players–but, in a nutshell, some developers spotted that same <code>for()</code> loop and built a slick UI on top.&nbsp;Upload your data, click through a workflow, walk away.&nbsp;Get your results in a few hours.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you&#8217;re a professional data scientist, you already have the knowledge and skills to test these models. Why would you want autoML to build models for you?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>It buys time and breathing room.</strong> An autoML solution may produce a &#8220;good enough&#8221; solution in just a few hours. At best, you&#8217;ll get a model you can put in production right now (short time-to-market), buying your team the time to custom-tune something else (to get better performance). At worst, the model&#8217;s performance is terrible, but it only took a few mouse clicks to determine that this problem is hairier than you&#8217;d anticipated. Or that, just maybe, your training data is no good for the challenge at hand.</li><li><strong>It&#8217;s convenient. Damn convenient.</strong> Especially when you consider how Certain Big Cloud Providers treat autoML as an on-ramp to model hosting. It takes a few clicks to build the model, then another few clicks to expose it as an endpoint for use in production. (Is autoML the bait for long-term model hosting? Could be. But that&#8217;s a story for another day.) Related to the previous point, a company could go from &#8220;raw data&#8221; to &#8220;it&#8217;s serving predictions on live data&#8221; in a single work day.</li><li><strong>You have other work to do.</strong> You&#8217;re not just building those models for the sake of building them. You need to coordinate with stakeholders and product managers to suss out what kinds of models you need and how to embed them into the company&#8217;s processes. And hopefully they&#8217;re not specifically asking you for a model, but asking you to use the company&#8217;s data to address a challenge.&nbsp;You need to spend some quality time understanding all of that data through the lens of the company&#8217;s business model. That will lead to additional data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering. Those require the kind of context and nuance that the autoML tools don&#8217;t (and can&#8217;t) have.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Software Is Hungry, May as Well Feed It</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Remember the old Marc Andreessen line that <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">software is eating the world</a>? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services — from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not.</em></p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This was the early days of developers spotting those <code>for()</code> loops and <code>if/then</code> constructs in the wild. If your business relied on a hard-and-fast rule, or a predictable sequence of events, someone was bound to write code to do the work and throw that on a few dozen servers to scale it out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And it made sense. People didn&#8217;t like performing the drudge work. Getting software to take the not-so-fun parts separated duties according to ability: tireless repetition to the computers, context and special attention to detail to the humans.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Andreessen wrote that piece more than a decade ago, but it still holds.&nbsp;Software continues to eat the world&#8217;s dull, repetitive, predictable tasks.&nbsp;Which is why software is eating AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>(Don&#8217;t feel bad.&nbsp;AI is also eating software, as with <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub&#8217;s Copilot</a>. Not to mention, some forms of creative expression. <a href=\"https://stability.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stable Diffusion</a>, anyone?&nbsp; The larger lesson here is that automation is a hungry beast. As we develop new tools for automation, we will bring more tasks within automation&#8217;s reach.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given that, let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re a data scientist in a company that&#8217;s adopted an autoML tool. Fast-forward a few months.&nbsp;What&#8217;s changed?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Your Team Looks Different</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Introducing autoML into your workflows has highlighted three roles on your data team. The first is the <strong>data scientist who came from a software development background,</strong> someone who&#8217;d probably be called a &#8220;machine learning engineer&#8221; in many companies. This person is comfortable talking to databases to pull data, then calling Pandas to transform it. In the past they understood the APIs of TensorFlow and Torch to build models by hand; today they are fluent in the autoML vendor&#8217;s APIs to train models, and they understand how to review the metrics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The second is the <strong>experienced ML professional who really knows how to build and tune models</strong>. That model from the autoML service is usually <em>good,</em> but not <em>great,</em> so the company still needs someone who can roll up their sleeves and squeeze out the last few percentage points of performance. Tool vendors make their money by scaling a solution across the most common challenges, right? That leaves plenty of niches the popular autoML solutions can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t handle. If a problem calls for a shiny new technique, or a large, branching neural network, someone on your team needs to handle that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Closely related is the third role, <strong>someone with a strong research background. </strong>When the well-known, well-supported algorithms no longer cut the mustard, you&#8217;ll need to either invent something whole cloth or translate ideas out of a research paper. Your autoML vendor won&#8217;t offer <em>that</em> solution for another couple of years, so, it&#8217;s your problem to solve if you need it today.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Notice that a sufficiently experienced person may fulfill multiple roles here. It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that a large shop probably needed people in all three roles even before autoML was a thing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>(If we twist that around: aside from the FAANGs and hedge funds, few companies have both the need and the capital to fund an ongoing ML research function. This kind of department provides very lumpy returns–the occasional big win that punctuates long stretches of &#8220;we&#8217;re looking into it.&#8221;)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That takes us to a conspicuous omission from that list of roles: the data scientists who focused on building basic models. AutoML tools are doing most of that work now, in the same way that the basic dashboards or visualizations are now the domain of self-service tools like AWS QuickSight, Google Data Studio, or Tableau.&nbsp;Companies will still need <em>advanced</em> ML modeling and data viz, sure. But that work goes to the advanced practitioners.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In fact, just about all of the data work is best suited for the advanced folks.&nbsp; AutoML really took a bite out of your entry-level hires. There&#8217;s just not much for them to do. Only the larger shops have the bandwidth to really bring someone up to speed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That said, even though the team structure has changed, <em>you still have a data team</em> when using an autoML solution<em>.</em> A company that is serious about doing ML/AI needs data scientists, machine learning engineers, and the like.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>You Have Refined Your Notion of &#8220;IP&#8221;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The code written to create most ML models was already a commodity. &nbsp; We&#8217;re all calling into the same Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Torch libraries, and we&#8217;re doing the same &#8220;convert data into tabular format, then feed to the algorithm&#8221; dance. The code we write looks very similar across companies and even industries, since so much of it is based on those open-source tools&#8217; call semantics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you see your ML models as the sum total of algorithms, glue code, and training data, then the harsh reality is that your data was the only unique intellectual property in the mix anyway.&nbsp;(And that&#8217;s only if you were building on proprietary data.) In machine learning, your competitive edge lies in business know-how and ability to execute. It does not exist in the code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AutoML drives this point home. Instead of invoking the open-source scikit-learn or Keras calls to build models, your team now goes from Pandas data transforms straight to … the API calls for AWS AutoPilot or GCP Vertex AI.&nbsp; The <code>for()</code> loop that actually builds and evaluates the models now lives on someone else&#8217;s systems. And it&#8217;s available to everyone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Your Job Has Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Building models is still part of the job, in the same way that developers still write a lot of code. While you called it &#8220;training an ML model,&#8221; developers saw &#8220;a <code>for()</code> loop that you&#8217;re executing by hand.&#8221; It&#8217;s time to let code handle that first pass at building models and let your role shift accordingly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What does that mean, then? I&#8217;ll finally deliver on the promise I made in the introduction. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the role of the data scientist (and ML engineer, and so on) is built on three pillars:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<ul><li><strong>Translating to numbers and back. </strong>ML models only see numbers, so machine learning is a numbers-in, numbers-out game. Companies need people who can translate real-world concepts into numbers (to properly train the models) and then translate the models&#8217; numeric outputs back into a real-world context (to make business decisions).&nbsp; Your model says &#8220;the price of this house should be $542,424.86&#8221;? Great. Now it&#8217;s time to explain to stakeholders how the model came to that conclusion, and how much faith they should put in the model&#8217;s answer.</li><li><strong>Understanding where and why the models break down:</strong> Closely related to the previous point is that models are, by definition, imperfect representations of real-world phenomena. When looking through the lens of your company&#8217;s business model, what is the impact of this model being incorrect? (That is: what <em>model risk</em> does the company face?) <br /><br />My friend Roger Magoulas reminded me of the old George Box quote that &#8220;all models are wrong, but some are useful.&#8221; Roger emphasized that we must consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the full quote</a>, which is:</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad.</em></p></blockquote>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Spotting ML opportunities in the wild:</strong> Machine learning does four things well: prediction (continuous outputs), classification (discrete outputs), grouping things (&#8220;what&#8217;s similar?&#8221;), and catching outliers (&#8220;where&#8217;s the weird stuff?&#8221;). In the same way that a developer can spot <code>for()</code> loops in the wild, experienced data scientists are adept at spotting those four use cases. They can tell when a predictive model is a suitable fit to augment or replace human activity, and more importantly, when it&#8217;s not.</li></ul>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sometimes this is as straightforward as seeing where a model could guide people. Say you overhear the sales team describing how they lose so much time chasing down leads that don&#8217;t work.&nbsp;The wasted time means they miss leads that probably would have panned out. &#8220;You know … Do you have a list of past leads and how they went? And are you able to describe them based on a handful of attributes? I could build a model to label a deal as a go/no-go. You could use the probabilities emitted alongside those labels to prioritize your calls to prospects.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other times it&#8217;s about freeing people from mind-numbing work, like watching security cameras. &#8220;What if we build a model to detect motion in the video feed? If we wire that into an alerts system, our staff could focus on other work while the model kept a watchful eye on the factory perimeter.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And then, in rare cases, you sort out new ways to express ML&#8217;s functionality. &#8220;So … when we invoke a model to classify a document, we&#8217;re really asking for a single label based on how it&#8217;s broken down the words and sequences in that block of text. What if we go the other way? Could we feed a model tons of text, and get it to <em>produce</em> text on demand? And what if that could apply to, say, code?&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>It Always Has Been&nbsp; </h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a high level, then, the role of the data scientist is <em>to understand data analysis and predictive modeling, in the context of the company&#8217;s use cases and needs</em>. It always has been. Building models was just on your plate because you were the only one around who knew how to do it.&nbsp;By offloading some of the model-building work to machines, autoML tools remove some of that distraction, allowing you to focus more on the data itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The data is certainly the most important part of all this.&nbsp;You can consider the off-the-shelf ML algorithms (available as robust, open-source implementations) and unlimited compute power (provided by cloud services) as constants. The only variable in your machine learning work–the only thing you can influence in your path to success–is the data itself.&nbsp; Andrew Ng emphasizes this point <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2021/06/16/andrew-ng-launches-a-campaign-for-data-centric-ai/?sh=1c28379874f5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in his drive for data-centric AI</a>, and I wholeheartedly agree.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Making the most of that data will require that you understand where it came from, assess its quality, and engineer it into features that the algorithms can use. This is the hard part. And it&#8217;s the part we can&#8217;t yet hand off to a machine. But once you&#8217;re ready, you can hand those features off to an autoML tool–your trusty assistant that handles the grunt work–to diligently use them to train and compare various models.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Software has once again eaten dull, repetitive, predictable tasks. And it has drawn a dividing line, separating work based on ability.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Where to Next?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some data scientists might claim that autoML is taking their job away.&nbsp;(We will, for the moment, skip past the irony of someone in tech complaining that a robot is taking their job.) Is that true, though? If you feel that building models is your job, then, yes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For the more experienced readers, autoML tools are a slick replacement for their trusty-but-rusty homegrown <code>for()</code> loops. A more polished solution for doing a first pass at building models. They see autoML tools, not as a threat, but as a <em>force multiplier</em> that will test a variety of algorithms and tuning parameters while they tackle the important work that actually requires human nuance and experience.&nbsp;Pay close attention to this group, because they have the right idea.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The data practitioners who embrace autoML tools will use their newfound free time to forge stronger connections to the company&#8217;s business model.&nbsp;They&#8217;ll look for novel ways to apply data analysis and ML models to products and business challenges, and try to find those pockets of opportunity that autoML tools can&#8217;t handle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you have entrepreneurship in your blood, you can build on that last point and create an upstart autoML company.

Funding comes and goes, of course, and with the possibility of a media-driven recession, there’s always the possibility of a funding collapse. Funding aside, 2022 has been a fantastic year for AI. GPT-3 wasn’t new, of course, but ChatGPT made GPT-3 usable in ways people hadn’t imagined. How will we use ChatGPT and its descendants? I don’t believe they put an end to search. When I search, I’m (usually) more interested in the source than I am in an “answer.” But I have a question.\\xa0 Much has been made about ChatGPT’s ability to “hallucinate” facts. I wonder whether that kind of hallucination could be a prelude to “artificial creativity”? I’ll try to have something more to say about that in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>GitHub CoPilot also wasn’t new in 2022, but in the last year we’ve heard of more and more programmers who are using ChatGPT to write production code. It isn’t just people “kicking the tires”; AI-generated code will inevitably be part of the future. The important questions are: who will it help, and how? Right now, it seems like CoPilot will be less likely to help beginners, and more likely to be a force-multiplier for experienced programmers, allowing them to focus more on what they are trying to do than on remembering details about syntax and libraries. In the longer term, it might bring about a complete change in what “computer programming” means.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney made it possible for people without artistic skills to generate pictures based on verbal descriptions, with results that are often fantastic. Google and Facebook haven’t released anything to the public, but they have demoed similar applications. All of these tools are raising important questions about intellectual property and copyright. They are already inspiring new startups with new applications, and those companies will inevitably attract investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Those tools aren’t without their problems, and if we really want to avoid another AI Winter, we’d do well to think about what those problems are. Intellectual property is one issue: GitHub is already being sued because CoPilot’s output can reproduce code that it was trained on, without regard for the code’s initial license. The art generation programs will inevitably face similar challenges: what happens when you tell an AI system to produce a drawing “in the style of” some artist? What happens when you ask the AI to create an avatar for a woman, and it creates something that’s highly sexualized? ChatGPT’s ability to produce plausible text output is spectacular, but its ability to discriminate fact from non-fact is limited. Will we see a Web that’s flooded with “fake news” and spam? We arguably have that already, but tools like ChatGPT can generate content at a scale that we can’t yet imagine.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At its heart, ChatGPT is really a user interface hack: a chat front end bolted onto an updated version of the GPT-3 language model. “User interface hack” sounds pejorative, but I don’t mean it that way.\\xa0We now need to start building new applications around these models.\\xa0UI design is important–and UI design for AI applications is a topic that hasn’t been adequately explored.\\xa0What can we build with large language and generative art models? How will these models interact with their human users?\\xa0 Exploring those questions will drive a lot of creativity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After ChatGPT, perhaps the biggest surprise of 2022 was the rise of Mastodon. Mastodon isn’t new, of course; I’ve been looking in from the outside for some time. I’ve never thought it had achieved critical mass, or that it was capable of achieving critical mass. I was proven wrong when Elon Musk’s antics drove thousands of Twitter users to Mastodon (including me). Mastodon is a federated network of communities that are (mostly) pleasant, friendly, and populated by smart people. The sudden influx of Twitter users proved that Mastodon could scale. There were some growing pains, but not as much as I would have expected. I haven’t seen a single “fail whale.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The growth of Mastodon proved that the federated model worked. It’s important to think about this. Mastodon is a decentralized service based on the ActivityPub protocol.\\xa0Nobody owns it; nobody controls it, though individuals control specific servers. And there isn’t a blockchain or a token in sight. In the past year, we’ve been treated to a steady diet of noise about Web3, most of which insists that the next step in online interaction must be built on a blockchain, that everything must be owned, everything must be paid for, and that rent collectors (aka “miners”) will have their hands out taking their cut on each transaction. I won’t go so far as to claim that Mastodon is Web3; but I do think that the next generation of the Web, however it evolves, will look much more like Mastodon than like OpenSea, and that it will be based on protocols like ActivityPub.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Which leads us to blockchains and crypto. I’m not going to engage in Schadenfreude here, but I’ve long wondered what can be built with blockchains. At one time, I thought that supply chain management would be the poster child for the Enterprise Blockchain. Unfortunately, IBM and Maersk have <a href=\"https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-and-ibm-abandon-blockchain-tradelens-platform\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">abandoned</a> their TradeLens project.\\xa0NFTs? I have always been skeptical of the connection between NFTs and the art world. NFTs seemed an awful lot like buying a painting and framing the receipt. They existed purely to show that you could spend cryptocurrency at scale, and the people who spent their coins that way have gotten what they deserved. But I’m not willing to say that there’s no value here. NFTs may help us to solve the problem of online identity, a problem that we haven’t yet solved on the Web (though I’m not convinced that NFT advocates have really understood how complex identity is). Are there other applications? A number of companies, including Starbucks and Universal Studios, are using NFTs to build <a href=\"https://blockandmortar.xyz/newsletter/022.of-loyalty-and-leadership-titles/?utm_source=blockandmortar&amp;utm_medium=email#web3-also-works-for-in-person-experiences\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">customer loyalty programs and theme park experiences</a>. At this point, NFTs still look like a technology in search of a problem to solve, but I suspect that the appropriate problem isn’t out there.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There was more in 2022, of course. Will we see a Metaverse, or was that just Facebook’s attempt to change the narrative about its actions? Will Europe continue to take the lead in regulating the tech sector, and will other nations follow? Will our daily lives be improved by a flood of interoperable smart devices? In 2023, we shall see.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/digesting-2022/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}, {'title': 'Radar Trends to Watch: January 2023', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Radar Trends to Watch: January 2023'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-january-2023/'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-january-2023/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-january-2023/#respond', 'published': 'Wed, 04 Jan 2023 11:53:08 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2023, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=4, tm_hour=11, tm_min=53, tm_sec=8, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=4, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Radar Trends', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=14826', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, December was a slow month.

I am not an attorney, but these issues need to be addressed–at least within the culture that surrounds the use of these models, if not the legal system itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copyright protects outputs of creative processes, not inputs. You can copyright a work you produced, whether that’s a computer program, a literary work, music, or an image. There is a concept of “fair use” that’s most applicable to text, but still applicable in other domains. The problem with fair use is that it is never precisely defined. The <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">US Copyright Office’s statement about fair use</a> is a model for vagueness:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Under the fair use doctrine of the U.S. copyright statute, it is permissible to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports. There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. Whether a particular use qualifies as fair use depends on all the circumstances.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are left with a web of conventions and traditions. You can’t quote another work in its entirety without permission. For a long time,\\xa0it was considered acceptable to quote up to 400 words without permission, though that &#8220;rule&#8221; was no more than an urban legend, and never part of copyright law. Counting words never shielded you from infringement claims–and in any case, it\\xa0applies poorly to software as well as works that aren&#8217;t written text. <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20fair%20use%20doctrine,news%20reporting%2C%20and%20scholarly%20reports.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Elsewhere</a> the US copyright office states that fair use includes ”transformative” use, though “transformative” has never been defined precisely. It also states that copyright does not extend to ideas or facts, only to particular expressions of those facts–but we have to ask where the “idea” ends and where the “expression” begins. Interpretation of these principles will have to come from the courts, and the body of US case law on software copyright is surprisingly small–only 13 cases, according to the copyright office’s <a href=\"https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">search engine</a>. Although the body of case law for music and other art forms is larger, it’s even less clear how these ideas apply. Just as quoting a poem in its entirety is a copyright violation, you can’t reproduce images in their entirety without permission. But how much of a song or a painting can you reproduce? Counting words isn’t just ill-defined, it is useless for works that aren’t made of words.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These rules of thumb are clearly about outputs, rather than inputs: again, the ideas that go into an article aren’t protected, just the words. That’s where generative models present problems. Under some circumstances, output from Copilot may contain, verbatim, lines from copyrighted code. The legal system has tools to handle this case, even if those tools are imprecise. Microsoft is currently being <a href=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/software/369456/github-copilot-sued-over-software-piracy-on-unprecendented-scale\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sued for “software piracy”</a> because of GitHub. The case is based on outputs: code generated by Copilot that reproduces code in its training set, but that doesn’t carry license notices or attribution. It’s about Copilot’s compliance with the license attached to the original software. However, that lawsuit doesn’t address the more important question. Copilot itself is a commercial product that is built a body of training data, even though it is completely different from that data. It’s clearly “transformative.” In any AI application, the training data is at least as important to the final product as the algorithms, if not more important. Should the rights of the authors of the training data be taken into account when a model is built from their work, even if the model never reproduces their work verbatim? Copyright does not adequately address the inputs to the algorithm at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can ask similar questions about works of art. Andy Baio has a great <a href=\"https://waxy.org/2022/11/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussion</a> of an artist, Hollie Mengert, whose work was used to train a specialized version of Stable Diffusion. This model enables anyone to produce Mengert-like artworks from a textual prompt. They’re not actual reproductions; and they’re not as good as her genuine artworks–but arguably “good enough” for most purposes. (If you ask Stable Diffusion to generate “Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci,” you get something that clearly looks like Mona Lisa, but that would embarrass poor Leonardo.) However, users of a model can produce dozens, or hundreds, of works in the time Mengert takes to make one. We certainly have to ask what it does to the value of Mengert’s art. Does copyright law protect “in the style of”? I don’t think anyone knows. Legal arguments over whether works generated by the model are “transformative” would be expensive, possibly endless, and likely pointless. (One hallmark of law in the US is that cases are almost always decided by people who aren’t experts. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Grotesque Legacy of Music as Property</a> shows how this applies to music.) And copyright law doesn’t protect the inputs to a creative process, whether that creative process is human or cybernetic. Should it? As humans, we are always learning from the work of others; “standing on the shoulders of giants” is a quote with a history that goes well before Isaac Newton used it. Are machines also allowed to stand on the shoulders of giants?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14807\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_01-973x1048.png\" /><figcaption><br />Mona Lisa in the style of DaVinci. DaVinci isn’t worried. (Courtesy Hugo Bowne-Anderson)</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To think about this, we need an understanding of what copyright does culturally. It’s a double-edged sword. I’ve written several times about how <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/01/on-pirates-and-piracy.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beethoven and Bach made use of popular tunes in their music</a>, in ways that certainly wouldn’t be legal under current copyright law. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz</a> is full of artists quoting, copying, and expanding on each other. So is classical music–we’ve just learned to ignore that part of the tradition. Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart could easily have been sued for their appropriation of popular music (for that matter, they could have sued each other, and been sued by many of their “legitimate” contemporaries)–but that process of appropriating and moving beyond is a crucial part of how art works. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14811\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/copyright_02.png\" /><figcaption><br />J. S. Bach’s 371 Choral Copyright Violations. He would have been in trouble if copyright as we now understand it had existed.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also have to recognize the protection that copyright gives to artists. We lost most of Elizabethan theater because there was no copyright.&nbsp;Plays were the property of the theater companies (and playwrights were often members of those companies), but that property wasn’t protected; there was nothing to prevent another company from performing your play.&nbsp; Consequently, playwrights had no interest in publishing their plays. The scripts were, literally, trade secrets. We’ve probably lost at least one play by Shakespeare (there’s evidence he wrote a play called Love’s Labors Won); we’ve lost all but one of the plays of Thomas Kyd; and there are other playwrights known through playbills, reviews, and other references for whom there are no surviving works. Christopher Marlowe’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Doctor Faustus</a>, the most important pre-Shakespearian play, is known to us through two editions, both published after Marlowe’s death, and one of those editions is roughly a third longer than the other. What did Marlowe actually write? We’ll never know. Without some kind of protection, authors had no interest in publishing at all, let alone publishing accurate texts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So there’s a finely tuned balance to copyright, which we almost certainly haven’t achieved in practice. It needs to protect creativity without destroying the ability to learn from and modify earlier works. Free and open source software couldn’t exist without the protection of copyright–though without that protection, open source might not be needed. Patents were intended to play a similar role: to encourage the spread of information by guaranteeing that inventors could profit from their invention, limiting the need for “trade secrets.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Copying works of art has always been (and still is) a part of an artist’s education. Authors write and rewrite each other’s works constantly; whole careers have been made tracing the interactions between John Milton and William Blake. Whether we’re talking about prose or painting, generative AI devalues traditional artistic technique (<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-technique/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as I’ve argued</a>), though possibly giving rise to a different kind of technique: the technique of writing prompts that tell the machine what to create. That’s a task that is neither simple nor uncreative. To take Mona Lisa and go a step further than Da Vinci–or to go beyond facile imitations of Hollie Mengert–requires an understanding of what this new medium can do, and how to control it. Part of Google’s <a href=\"https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/11/07/google-generative-ai-strategy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI strategy</a> appears to be building tools that help artists to <a href=\"https://wordcraft-writers-workshop.appspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">collaborate</a> with AI systems; their goal is&nbsp; to enable authors to create works that are transformative, that do more than simply reproducing a style or piecing together sentences. This kind of work certainly raises questions of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/people/mike-loukides/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reproducibility</a>: given the output of an AI system, can that output be recreated or modified in predictable ways? And it might cause us to realize that the old cliche “A picture is worth a thousand words” significantly underestimates the number of words it takes to describe a picture.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How do we best protect creative freedom?&nbsp;Is a work of art something that can be “owned,” and what does that mean in an age when digital works can be reproduced perfectly, at will? We need to protect both the original artists, like Hollie Mengert, and those who use their original work as a springboard to go beyond. Our current copyright system does that poorly, if at all. (And the existence of patent trolls demonstrates that patent law hasn’t done much better.)&nbsp; What was originally intended to protect artists has turned into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFUdIZnI5o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rent-seeking game in which artists who can afford lawyers monetize the creativity of artists who can’t</a>. Copyright needs to protect the input side of any generative system: it needs to govern the use of intellectual property as training data for machines. But copyright also needs to protect the people who are being genuinely creative with those machines: not just making more works “in the style of,” but treating AI as a new artistic medium. The finely tuned balance that copyright needs to maintain has just become more difficult. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There may be solutions outside of the copyright system. Shutterstock, which previously announced that they were removing all AI-generated images from their catalog, has announced a <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2343953-shutterstock-will-sell-ai-generated-art-and-compensate-human-artists/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration with OpenAI</a> that allow the creation of images using a model that has only been trained on images licensed to Shutterstock. Creators of the images used for training will receive a royalty based on images created by the model. Shutterstock hasn’t released any details about the compensation plan, and it’s easy to suspect that the actual payments will be similar to the royalties musicians get from streaming services: microcents per use. But their approach could work with the right compensation plan. Deviant Art has released <a href=\"https://www.dreamup.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DreamUp</a>, a model based on Stable Diffusion that allows artists to specify whether models can be trained on their content, along with identifying all of its outputs as computer generated. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/adobe-stock-begins-selling-ai-generated-artwork/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has just announced their own set of <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/stock/contributor/help/generative-ai-content.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a> for submitting generative art to their Adobe Stock collection, which requiring that AI-generated art be labeled as such, and that the (human) creators have obtained all the licenses that might be required for the work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These solutions could be taken a step further. What if the models were trained on licenses, in addition to the original works themselves? It is easy to imagine an AI system that has been trained on the (many) Open Source and Creative Commons licenses. A user could specify what license terms were acceptable, and the system would generate appropriate output–including licenses and attributions, and taking care of compensation where necessary. We need to remember that few of the current generative AI tools that now exist can be used “for free.” They generate income, and that income can be used to compensate creators.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ultimately we need both solutions: fixing copyright law to accommodate works used to train AI systems, and developing AI systems that respect the rights of the people who made the works on which their models were trained. One can’t happen without the other.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-does-copyright-say-about-generative-models/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}, {'title': 'Radar Trends to Watch: December 2022', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Radar Trends to Watch: December 2022'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-december-2022/'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-december-2022/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/radar-trends-to-watch-december-2022/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 06 Dec 2022 12:21:48 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=6, tm_hour=12, tm_min=21, tm_sec=48, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=340, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Radar Trends', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Signals', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=14799', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'This month’s news has been overshadowed by the implosion of SBF’s TFX and the possible implosion of Elon Musk’s Twitter.

The financial collapse of 2008 led to tighter regulation of banks and financial institutions. The Three Mile Island accident led to safety improvements across the nuclear power industry.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sometimes a series of negative headlines can shift opinion and amplify our awareness of lurking vulnerabilities. For years, malicious computer worms and viruses were the stuff of science fiction. Then we experienced Melissa, Mydoom, and WannaCry. Cybersecurity itself was considered an esoteric backroom technology problem until we learned of the Equifax breach, the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, Log4j vulnerability, and the massive SolarWinds hack. We didn’t really care about cybersecurity until events forced us to pay attention.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI’s “SolarWinds moment” would make it a boardroom issue at many companies. If an AI solution caused widespread harm, regulatory bodies with investigative resources and powers of subpoena would jump in. Board members, directors, and corporate officers could be held liable and might face prosecution. The idea of corporations paying huge fines and technology executives going to jail for misusing AI isn’t far-fetched–the European Commission’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698792/EPRS_BRI(2021)698792_EN.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI Act</a> includes three levels of sanctions for non-compliance, with fines up to €30 million or 6% of total worldwide annual income, depending on the severity of the violation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A couple of years ago, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) introduced a bill requiring “companies to assess the algorithms that process consumer data to examine their impact on accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy, and security.” The bill also included stiff criminal penalties “for senior executives who knowingly lie” to the Federal Trade Commission about their use of data. While it’s unlikely that the bill will become law, merely raising the possibility of criminal prosecution and jail time has upped the ante for “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1444\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commercial entities that operate high-risk information systems or automated-decision systems, such as those that use artificial intelligence or machine learning</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>AI + Neuroscience + Quantum Computing: The Nightmare Scenario</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Compared to cybersecurity risks, the scale of AI’s destructive power is potentially far greater. When AI has its “Solar Winds moment,” the impact may be significantly more catastrophic than a series of cybersecurity breaches. Ask AI experts to share their worst fears about AI and they’re likely to mention scenarios in which AI is combined with neuroscience and quantum computing. You think AI is scary now? Just wait until it’s running on a quantum coprocessor and connected to your brain.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here’s a more likely nightmare scenario that doesn’t even require any novel technologies: State or local governments using AI, facial recognition, and license plate readers to identify, shame, or prosecute families or individuals who engage in behaviors that are deemed immoral or anti-social. Those behaviors could range from promoting a banned book to seeking an abortion in a state where abortion has been severely restricted.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI is in its infancy, but the clock is ticking. The good news is that plenty of people in the AI community have been thinking, talking, and writing about AI ethics. Examples of organizations providing insight and resources on ethical uses of AI and machine learning include \\u200b<a href=\"https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/research/algorithmic-bias\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business</a>, \\u200b<a href=\"https://www.latech4good.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LA Tech4Good</a>, <a href=\"https://mcsilver.nyu.edu/ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The AI Hub at McSilver</a>, <a href=\"https://ai-4-all.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AI4ALL</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Algorithmic Justice League</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s no shortage of suggested remedies in the hopper. Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, corporations, non-profits, think tanks, and universities have generated a prolific flow of proposals for rules, regulations, guidelines, frameworks, principles, and policies that would limit abuse of AI and ensure that it’s used in ways that are beneficial rather than harmful. The White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy recently published the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The blueprint is an unenforceable document. But it includes five refreshingly blunt principles that, if implemented, would greatly reduce the dangers posed by unregulated AI solutions.<strong> </strong>Here are the blueprint’s five basic principles:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>You should be protected from unsafe or ineffective systems.</li><li>You should not face discrimination by algorithms and systems should be used and designed in an equitable way.</li><li>You should be protected from abusive data practices via built-in protections and you should have agency over how data about you is used. </li><li>You should know that an automated system is being used and understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you.</li><li>You should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly consider and remedy problems you encounter.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to note that each of the five principles addresses outcomes, rather than processes. Cathy O’Neil, the author of <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241363/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-oneil/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em></a>, has suggested a similar outcomes-based approach for reducing specific harms caused by algorithmic bias. An outcomes-based strategy would look at the impact of an AI or ML solution on specific categories and subgroups of stakeholders. That kind of granular approach would make it easier to develop statistical tests that could determine if the solution is harming any of the groups. Once the impact has been determined, it should be easier to modify the AI solution and mitigate its harmful effects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gamifying or crowdsourcing bias detection are also effective tactics. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-ethical-ai-team/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Before it was disbanded</a>, Twitter’s AI ethics team successfully ran a “bias bounty” contest that allowed researchers from outside the company to examine an automatic photo-cropping algorithm that favored white people over Black people.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Shifting the Responsibility Back to People</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Focusing on outcomes instead of processes is critical since it fundamentally shifts the burden of responsibility from the AI solution to the people operating it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ana Chubinidze, founder of <a href=\"https://www.adalanai.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AdalanAI</a>, a software platform for&nbsp;AI Governance based in Berlin, says that using terms like “ethical AI” and “responsible AI” blur the issue by suggesting that an AI solution–rather than the people who are using it–should be held responsible when it does something bad. She raises an excellent point: AI is just another tool we’ve invented. The onus is on us to behave ethically when we’re using it. If we don’t, then we are unethical, not the AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why does it matter who–or what–is responsible? It matters because we already have methods, techniques, and strategies for encouraging and enforcing responsibility in human beings. Teaching responsibility and passing it from one generation to the next is a standard feature of civilization. We don’t know how to do that for machines. At least not yet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An era of fully autonomous AI is on the horizon. Would granting AIs full autonomy make them responsible for their decisions? If so, whose ethics will guide their decision-making processes? Who will watch the watchmen?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@blaisea?source=post_page-----42a02a57fadb--------------------------------\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blaise Aguera y Arcas</a>, a vice president and fellow at Google Research, has written a long, eloquent and well-documented <a href=\"https://medium.com/@blaisea/can-machines-learn-how-to-behave-42a02a57fadb\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> about the possibilities for teaching AIs to genuinely understand human values. His article, titled, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@blaisea/can-machines-learn-how-to-behave-42a02a57fadb\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Can machines learn how to behave?</em></a> is worth reading. It makes a strong case for the eventuality of machines acquiring a sense of fairness and moral responsibility. But it’s fair to ask whether we–as a society and as a species–are prepared to deal with the consequences of handing basic human responsibilities to autonomous AIs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Preparing for What Happens Next</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Today, most people aren’t interested in the sticky details of AI and its long-term impact on society. Within the software community, it often feels as though we’re inundated with articles, papers, and conferences on AI ethics. “But we’re in a bubble and there is very little awareness outside of the bubble,” says Chubinidze. “Awareness is always the first step. Then we can agree that we have a problem and that we need to solve it. Progress is slow because most people aren’t aware of the problem.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But rest assured: AI will have its “SolarWinds moment.” And when that moment of crisis arrives, AI will become truly controversial, similar to the way that social media has become a flashpoint for contentious arguments over personal freedom, corporate responsibility, free markets, and government regulation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Despite hand-wringing, article-writing, and congressional panels, social media remains largely unregulated. Based on our track record with social media, is it reasonable to expect that we can summon the gumption to effectively regulate AI?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The answer is yes. Public perception of AI is very different from public perception of social media. In its early days, social media was regarded as “harmless” entertainment; it took several years for it to evolve into a widely loathed platform for spreading hatred and disseminating misinformation. Fear and mistrust of AI, on the other hand, has been a staple of popular culture for decades.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Gut-level fear of AI may indeed make it easier to enact and enforce strong regulations when the tipping point occurs and people begin clamoring for their elected officials to “do something” about AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, we can learn from the experiences of the EC. The draft version of the AI Act, which includes the views of various stakeholders, has generated demands from civil rights organizations for “wider prohibition and regulation of AI systems.” Stakeholders have called for “a ban on indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted use of biometrics in public or publicly-accessible spaces and for restrictions on the uses of AI systems, including for border control and predictive policing.” Commenters on the draft have encouraged “a wider ban on the use of AI to categorize people based on physiological, behavioral or biometric data, for emotion recognition, as well as dangerous uses in the context of policing, migration, asylum, and border management.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of these ideas, suggestions, and proposals are slowly forming a foundational level of consensus that’s likely to come in handy when people begin taking the risks of unregulated AI more seriously than they are today.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Minerva Tantoco, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.citystrategiesllc.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">City Strategies LLC</a> and New York City’s first chief technology officer, describes herself as “an optimist and also a pragmatist” when considering the future of AI. “Good outcomes do not happen on their own. For tools like artificial intelligence, ethical, positive outcomes will require an active approach to developing guidelines, toolkits, testing and transparency. I am optimistic but we need to actively engage and question the use of AI and its impact,” she says.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tantoco notes that, “We as a society are still at the beginning of understanding the impact of AI on our daily lives, whether it is our health, finances, employment, or the messages we see.” Yet she sees “cause for hope in the growing awareness that AI must be used intentionally to be accurate, and equitable … There is also an awareness among policymakers that AI can be used for positive impact, and that regulations and guidelines will be necessary to help assure positive outcomes.”</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ais-solarwinds-moment-will-occur-its-just-a-matter-of-when/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}, {'title': 'Technical Health Isn’t Optional', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Technical Health Isn’t Optional'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/technical-health-isnt-optional/'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/technical-health-isnt-optional/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/technical-health-isnt-optional/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 22 Nov 2022 12:25:18 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=22, tm_hour=12, tm_min=25, tm_sec=18, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=326, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Open Source', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Programming', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Commentary', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=14780', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'If every company is a technology company, then every healthy company must have a healthy relationship to technology.

However, we haven’t seen any discussions of “technical health,” which suggests that industry at large doesn’t know what differentiates a company that’s been through a successful digital transformation from one that’s struggling. To help us understand technological health, we asked several CTOs in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region what their companies are doing to prevent security incidents, how they use open source software, how they use technology strategically, and how they retain employees in a challenging job market. We hope that their answers will help companies to build their own strategies for digital transformation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Being Proactive About Security</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked the CTOs how the companies prepared themselves for both old and new vulnerabilities. The key is being proactive, as Shashank Kaul, CTO of Webjet, noted. It’s important to use tools to scan for vulnerabilities—particularly tools provided by cloud vendors, such as Microsoft Azure’s <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Container Registry</a>, which integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly known as Azure Security Center) to scan containers for vulnerabilities continuously. They also make use of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub’s Dependabot alerts</a>, which are warnings generated when code in a GitHub repository uses a dependency with known vulnerabilities or malware. This proactive approach reflects an important shift from older reactive approaches to security, in which you deploy software and hope nothing bad happens. Tools like Container Registry and Dependabot alerts are constantly inspecting your code so they can warn about potential problems before they become actual problems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tim Hope, CTO of Versent, pointed to the importance of identity and role management in the cloud. Jyotiswarup Raiturkar, CTO of Angel One, said something very similar, highlighting the key role played by a <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">zero trust</a> policy that requires continuous validation (i.e., an identity is validated every time a resource is accessed). Raiturkar also emphasized the importance of “least privilege,” in which access to resources is limited on a “need to know” basis. Least privilege and zero trust go together: if you constantly verify identities, and only allow those entities access to the minimum information they need to do their job, you’ve made life much harder for an attacker. Unfortunately, almost all cloud services grant privileges that are overly permissive. It’s been widely reported that many—perhaps most—cloud vulnerabilities stem from <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/research-iam-permissive-misconfigured/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">misconfigured identity and access management</a>; we’d bet that the same applies to applications that run on-premises.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s also important to recognize that “identities” aren’t limited to humans. In a modern software architecture, a lot of the work will be performed by services that access other services, and each service needs its own identity and its own set of privileges. Again, the key is being proactive: thinking in advance about what identities are needed in the system and determining the appropriate privileges that should be granted to each identity. Giving every user and service broad access just because it’s easier to make the system work is a recipe for failure. If you think rigorously about exactly what access every service and user needs, and implement that carefully, you’ve blocked the most important path through which an attacker can breach your infrastructure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Threat modeling and penetration testing are also key components of a good security strategy, as Raiturkar pointed out. Threat modeling can help you assess the threats that you actually face, how likely they are, and the damage a successful attack can cause. It’s impossible to defend against every possible attack; a company needs to understand its assets and how they’re protected, then assess where it’s most vulnerable. Penetration testing is an important tool for determining how vulnerable you really are rather than how vulnerable you <em>think</em> you are. The insights you derive from hiring a professional to attack your own resources are almost always humbling—but being humbled is always preferable to being surprised. Although penetration testing is largely a manual process, don’t neglect the <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/best-automated-penetration-testing-tools/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">automated tools</a> that are appearing on the scene. Your attackers will certainly be using automated tools to break down your defenses. Remember: an attacker only needs to find one vulnerability that escaped your attention. Better that someone on your team discovers that vulnerability first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Open Source and a Culture of Sharing</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rise of open source software in the 1990s has undoubtedly transformed IT. While vendor lock-in is still a very real issue, the availability of open source software has done a lot to liberate IT. You’re no longer tied to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Equipment</a> hardware because you bought a DEC compiler and have a few million lines of code using proprietary extensions (a very real problem for technologists in the 1980s and 1990s). More importantly, open source has unleashed tremendous creativity. The internet wouldn&#8217;t exist without open source. Nor would many popular programming languages, including Go, Rust, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. And although C and C++ aren’t open source, they’d be much less important without the free <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GCC</a> compiler. At the same time, it’s possible to see the cloud as a retreat from open source: you neither know nor care where the software that implements Azure or AWS came from, and many of the services your cloud provider offers are likely to be rebranded versions of open source source platforms. This practice is controversial but probably unavoidable given the nature of open source licenses.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So we asked CTOs what role open source played in their organizations. All of the CTOs said that their organizations make use of open source software and frameworks. Chander Damodaran of Brillio noted that, “the culture of sharing solutions, frameworks, and industry-leading practices” has been a crucial part of Brillio’s journey. Similarly, Tim Hope said that open source is critical in building an engineering culture and developing systems. That’s an important statement. Too many articles about engineering culture have focused on foosball and beer in the company fridge. Engineering culture must focus on getting the job done effectively, whether that’s building, maintaining, or running software. These responses suggest that sharing knowledge and solutions is the true heart of engineering culture, and that’s visibly demonstrated by open source. It’s an effective way to get software tools and components that you wouldn’t be able to develop on your own. Furthermore, those tools aren’t tied to a single vendor that might be acquired or go out of business. In the best case, they’re maintained by large communities that also have a stake in ensuring the software’s quality. Bill Joy, one of Sun Microsystems’ founders, famously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy%27s_law_(management)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a>, “No matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else.” Open source allows you to use the contributions of those many smart people who will never be on your staff.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, only two of the CTOs we asked indicated that their staff were able to contribute to open source projects. One of the CTOs said that they were working toward policies that would allow their developers to release projects with company support. It’s almost impossible to imagine a technical company that doesn’t use open source somewhere. The use of open source is so widespread that the health of open source is directly tied to the health of the entire technology sector. That’s why a critical bug in an important project—for example, the recent <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Log4j vulnerability</a>—has serious worldwide ramifications. It’s important for companies to contribute back to open source projects: fixing bugs, <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plugging vulnerabilities</a>, adding features, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/16/white-house-open-source-security/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">funding</a> the many developers who maintain projects on a volunteer basis.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Thinking Strategically About Software</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The CTOs we questioned had similar views of the strategic function of IT, though they differed in the details. Everyone stressed the importance of delivering value to the customer; value to the customer translates directly into business value. The best approach to delivering this value depends on the application—as Shashank Kaul pointed out, that might require building custom software; outsourcing parts of a project but keeping core, unique aspects of the project internal; or even buying commercial off-the-shelf software. The “build versus buy” decision has plagued CTOs for years. There are many frameworks for making these decisions (just google “build vs buy”), but the key concept is understanding your company’s core value proposition. What makes your company unique? That’s where you should focus your software development effort. Almost everything else can be acquired through open source or commercial software.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>According to Tim Hope, the IT group at Versent is small. Most of their work involves integrating software-as-a-service solutions. They don’t build much custom software; they provide data governance and guidelines for other business units, which are responsible for building their own software. While the development of internal tools can take place as needed in different business units, it’s important to realize that data governance is, by nature, centralized. A company needs a standard set of policies about how to handle data, and those policies need to be enforced across the whole organization. Those standards will only become more crucial as regulations about data usage become more prevalent. Companies that haven’t adopted some form of data governance will be playing a high-stakes game of catch-up.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Likewise, Jyotiswarup Raiturkar at Angel One focuses on long-term value. Angel One distinguishes between IT, which supports internal tools (such as email), and the “tech team,” which is focused on product development. The tech team is investing heavily in building low-latency, high-throughput systems that are the lifeblood of a financial services company. Like Versent, Angel One is investing in platforms that support data discovery, data lineage, and data exploration. It should be noted that tracking data lineage is a key part of data governance. It’s extremely important to know where data comes from and how it’s gathered—and that’s particularly true for a firm in financial services, a sector that’s heavily regulated. These aren’t questions that can be left to ad hoc last-minute solutions; data governance has to be consistent throughout the organization.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although software for internal users (sometimes called “internal customers”) was mentioned, it wasn’t a focus for any of the IT leaders we contacted. We hear increasingly about “self-service” data, democratization, “low code,” and other movements that allow business units to create their own applications. Whatever you call it, it seems that one role for a company’s technology organization is to enable the other business units to serve themselves. IT groups are also responsible for internal tools that are created to make the existing staff more efficient while avoiding the trap of turning internal projects into large IT commitments that are difficult to maintain and never really satisfy the users’ needs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One solution is for the IT group to encourage employees in other divisions to build their own tools as they need them. This approach puts the IT group in the role of consultants and helpers rather than developers. It requires building a technology stack that’s appropriate for nontechnical employees. For instance, the IT group may need to build a data mesh that allows different units to manage their own data while using the data from other parts of the organization as needed, all subject to good policies for data governance, access control, and security. They’ll also need to learn about appropriate <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/low-code-and-the/9781098112592/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">low-code and no-code</a> tools that allow employees to build what they need even if they don’t have software development skills. This investment will give the rest of the company better tools to work with. Users will be able to build exactly what they need, without passing requests up and down an error-prone chain of command to reach the software developers. And the IT burden of maintaining these in-house tools will (we hope) be reduced.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Keeping Employees Happy and Challenged</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It goes without saying, but we’ll say it anyway: even with news of tech sector layoffs, today’s job market is very good for employees trying to find new jobs, and very tough for employers trying to hire to support company growth. In many organizations, even maintaining the status quo is a challenge. What are APAC CTOs doing to keep their staff from jumping ship?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every company had training and development programs, and most had multiple programs, adapted to different learning styles and needs. Some offered online training experiences only; Angel One provides both online and in-person training to its employees. Offering programs for employee training and development is clearly “table stakes,” a necessity for technological health.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s more important to look at what goes beyond the basics. Webjet recognizes that training can’t just take place outside of business hours. Managers are charged to carve out work time (roughly 10%) for employees to participate in training—and while 10% sounds like a small number, that’s a significant investment, on the order of 200 hours per year devoted to training. It’s worth noting that our <a href=\"https://get.oreilly.com/ind_2021-data-ai-salary-survey.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>2021 Data &amp; AI Salary Survey</em></a> report showed that the largest salary increases went to employees who spent over 100 hours in training programs. While it’s a crude metric, those salary increases clearly say something about the value of training to an employer.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shashank Kaul also observed that Webjet keeps its IT developers as close as possible to the problems being solved, and in conversation with their counterparts at customers’ firms, avoiding the problem of becoming a “feature factory.” This description reminds us of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extreme programming</a>, with its regular demos and contact with customers that allowed software projects to keep on target through many midcourse corrections. It’s important that Kaul also sees contact with customers and peers as an aid in retaining engineers: no one likes to spend time implementing features that are never used, particularly when they result from inadequate communication about the actual problems being solved. Webjet and Versent also run regular employee hackathons, where anyone in the organization can participate in solving problems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jyotiswarup Raiturkar offered some additional ideas to keep employees happy and productive. Angel One has a “permanent work from anywhere” policy that makes it much easier for employees to balance work with their personal life and goals. The ability to work from home, and the time that you get back by avoiding a lengthy commute, is worth a lot: in congested cities, an 8-hour day can easily become a 10- to 12-hour commitment. It’s important that this policy is permanent: employees at many companies got used to working at home during the pandemic and are now unhappy at being asked to return to offices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Raiturkar also noted that Angel One’s employees can roll out features in their first few days at the company, something we’ve seen at companies that practice DevOps. An important part of Facebook’s “bootcamp” for new employees has been requiring them to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/dev/facebook-bootcamp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">deploy code to the site on their first day</a>. Continuous deployment may have more to do with software engineering than human resources, but nothing makes employees feel more like they’re part of a team than the ability to see changes go into production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What Is Technical Health?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this brief look at the experience of CTOs in the APAC region, we see a proactive approach to security that includes the software supply chain. We see widespread use of open source, even if employees are limited in their freedom to contribute back to open source projects. We see Agile and DevOps practices that put software developers in touch with their users so that they’re always headed in the right direction. And we see training, hackathons, and work-from-anywhere policies that let employees know that they, their careers, and their home lives are valued.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We hope all companies will consider technical health periodically, ideally when they’re forming plans and setting goals for the coming year. As the business world moves further and further into a radical technical transformation, every company needs to put in place practices that contribute to a healthy technical environment. If all companies are software companies, technical health is not optional.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/technical-health-isnt-optional/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}, {'title': 'Healthy Data', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Healthy Data'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/healthy-data/'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/healthy-data/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/healthy-data/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 15 Nov 2022 15:18:53 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=15, tm_hour=15, tm_min=18, tm_sec=53, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=319, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Data', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Research', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=14784', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'This summer, we started asking about “technical health.” We don’t see a lot of people asking what it means to use technology in healthy ways, at least not in so many words.

That’s understandable because “technical health” is so broad that it’s difficult to think about.&nbsp; It’s easy to ask a question like “Are you using agile methodologies?” and assume that means “technical health.”&nbsp; Agile is good, right?&nbsp; But agile is not the whole picture. Neither is being “data driven.” Or Lean. Or using the latest, coolest programming languages and frameworks. Nor are any of these trends, present or past, irrelevant.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To investigate what’s meant by “technical health,” we have begun a series of short surveys to help us understand about what technical health means, and to help our readers think about the technical health of their organizations. The first survey looked at the use of data. It ran from August 30, 2022 to September 30, 2022. We received 693 responses, of which 337 were complete (i.e., the respondent answered all the questions). We didn’t include the incomplete respondents in our results, a practice that’s consistent with our other, lengthier surveys.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No single question and answer stood out; we can’t say “everybody does X” or “nobody does Y.” Whether or not that’s healthy in and of itself, it suggests that there isn’t yet any consensus about the role data plays. For example, the first question was “What percentage of enterprise-wide decisions are driven primarily by data?”&nbsp;19% of the respondents answered “25% or less”; 31% said “76% or more.” We were surprised to see that the percentage of respondents who said that most decisions aren’t data driven was so similar to the percentage who thought they are. The difference between 19% and 31% looks much larger on paper than it is in practice. Yes, it’s almost a 2:1 ratio, but it shows that a lot of respondent work for companies that aren’t using data in their decision making. Even more significant, fully half of the respondents put their companies in the “sort of data driven” middle ground (26-50% and 51-75% received 25% and 26% of responses, respectively.) Does this mean that most companies are somewhere along the path towards being data-driven, with the “25% or less” cohort representing companies that are “catching up”? It’s hard to say.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We saw similar answers when we asked what percentage of business processes are informed by real-time data: 33% of respondents said 25% or less, while 21% said 76% or more. (26-50% and 51-75% received 22% and 24% of responses, respectively.) <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-is-hyperautomation/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Incorporating real-time data into business processes</a> is a heavier lift than running a few reports before a management meeting, so it isn’t surprising that fewer people are making widespread use of real-time data. These responses also suggest that the industry is in the process of transformation, of deciding how to use real-time data. There are many possibilities: managing inventory, supply chains, and manufacturing processes; automating customer service; and reducing time spent on routine paperwork, to name a few. But we don’t yet see a clear direction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The bane of data science has been the HIPPO: the “highest paid person’s opinion.” When the HIPPO is in the room, data is used primarily to justify decisions that have already been made. The questions we asked don’t tell us much about the presence of the HIPPO, but we have to wonder: Is that why 20% of the respondents say that data doesn’t have a big influence in corporate decision-making?&nbsp;Are the 31% who said that over 75% of management decisions are based on data being ironic or naive? We don’t know, and need to keep that ambiguity in mind.&nbsp;Data can’t be the final word in any decision; we can’t underestimate the importance of instinct and a gut understanding of business dynamics. Data is always historical and, as such, is often better at maintaining a status quo than at helping to build a future–though when used well, data can shine light on the status quo, and help you question it. Data that’s used solely to justify the HIPPO isn’t healthy. Our survey doesn’t say much about the influence of the HIPPO. That’s something you’ll need to ponder when considering your company’s technical health.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve been tracking the democratization of data–the ability of staff members who aren’t data scientists, analysts, or something else with “data” in their title–to access and use data in their job. Staff members need the ability to access and use data on their own, without going through intermediaries like database administrators (DBAs) and other custodians to generate reports and give them the data they need to work effectively. Self-service data is at the heart of the democratization process–and being data-driven isn’t meaningful if only a select priesthood has access to the data.&nbsp; Companies are slowly waking up to this reality. 26% of the respondents to our survey said that less than 20% of their company’s information workers had access to self-service query and analytics. That’s arguably a high percentage (and it was the most popular single answer), but we choose to see the glass as half (or three quarters) full: 74% said that more than 20% had access. (23% of the respondents said that 41% to 60% of their company’s data workers had self-service; 15% chose 61% to 80%; and 16% chose 81% to 100%.) No answer jumps out–but remember that, not so long ago, data was the property of actuaries, analysts, and DBAs. The walls between staff members and the data they need to do their job started to break down with the “data science” movement, but data scientists were still specialists and professionals. We’re still making the transition, but our survey shows that data is becoming more accessible, to more people, and we believe that’s healthy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Roughly one third (35%) of the respondents said that their organization used a data catalog. That seems low, but it isn’t surprising. While we like to tell each other how quickly technology changes, the fact is that real adoption is almost always slow. Data catalogs are a relatively new technology; their age is measured in years, not decades. They’re gradually being accepted.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We got a similar result when we asked about data governance tools. 58% of the respondents said they weren’t using anything (“None of the above,” but “the above” included an option for a write-in.) SAP, IBM, SAS, and Informatica were leading choices (21%, 14%, 12%, and 11% respectively; respondents could select multiple answers). Again, we expect adoption of data governance tools to be slow. Data has been the “wild west” of the technology world for years, with few restrictions on what any organization could do with the data it collected. That party is coming to the end, but nobody’s pretending that the hangover is pleasant. Like data catalogs (to which they’re closely related), governance tools are relatively new and being adopted gradually.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Looking at the bigger picture, we see that companies are grappling with the demands of self-service data. They are also facing increasing regulation governing the use of data. Both of these trends require tooling to support them. Catalogs help users find and maintain metadata that shows what data exists and how it should be used; governance tools track data provenance and ensure that data is used in accordance with company policies and regulations. Fifteen years ago, we frequently heard “save everything, and wring every bit of value you can out of your data.” In the 2020s, it’s hard to see that as a good, healthy attitude. An important part of technological health is a commitment to use data ethically and legally. We believe we see movement in that direction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the coming months, we’ll investigate technical health in other areas (next up is Security). For data health, we can close with some observations:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Data can’t be the only factor in decision making; human judgment plays an important role. But using data simply to justify a human decision that’s already been made is also a mistake. Technical health means knowing when and how to use data effectively; it’s a continuum, not a choice. We believe that companies are on the path to understanding that.</li><li>Empowering staff to make their own data queries and perform their own analyses can help them become more productive and engaged. But this doesn’t happen on its own. People need to know what data is available to them, and what that data means. That’s the purpose of a data catalog. And the use of data has to comply with regulations and company policies; that’s the purpose of governance. Data catalogs and governance tools are making inroads, but they’ve only started. Technical health means empowering users with the tools they need to make effective, ethical, and legal use of data.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Healthy data improves processes, questions preconceived opinions, and shines a light on practices that are unfair or discriminatory. We don’t expect anyone to look at their company and say “our data practices deserve a gold star”; that misses the point.&nbsp;Maintaining a healthy relationship to data is an ongoing practice, and that practice is still developing. We are learning to make better decisions with data; we are learning to implement governance to use data ethically (to say nothing of legally). Data health means that you and your company are on the path, not that you’ve arrived. We’re all making the same journey.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/healthy-data/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}, {'title': 'Formal Informal Languages', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Formal Informal Languages'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/formal-informal-languages/'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/formal-informal-languages/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/formal-informal-languages/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 08 Nov 2022 11:58:09 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=8, tm_hour=11, tm_min=58, tm_sec=9, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=312, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Programming', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Commentary', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=14772', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'We’ve all been impressed by the generative art models: DALL-E, Imagen, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and now Facebook’s generative video model, Make-A-Video.

They’re easy to use, and the results are impressive. They also raise some fascinating questions about programming languages. Prompt engineering, designing the prompts that drive these models, is likely to be a new specialty. There’s already a self-published book about <a href=\"https://dallery.gallery/the-dalle-2-prompt-book/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prompt engineering for DALL-E</a>, and an excellent tutorial about <a href=\"https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/an-advanced-guide-to-writing-prompts-for-midjourney-text-to-image-aa12a1e33b6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">prompt engineering for Midjourney</a>. Ultimately, what we’re doing when crafting a prompt is programming–but not the kind of programming we’re used to. The input is free form text, not a programming language as we know it. It’s natural language, or at least it’s supposed to be: there’s no formal grammar or syntax behind it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Books, articles, and courses about prompt engineering are inevitably teaching a language, the language you need to know to talk to DALL-E. Right now, it’s an informal language, not a formal language with a specification in BNF or some other metalanguage. But as this segment of the AI industry develops, what will people expect? Will people expect prompts that worked with version 1.X of DALL-E to work with version 1.Y or 2.Z? If we compile a C program first with GCC and then with Clang, we don’t expect the same machine code, but we do expect the program to do the same thing. We have these expectations because C, Java, and other programming languages are precisely defined in documents ratified by a standards committee or some other body, and we expect departures from compatibility to be well documented. For that matter, if we write “Hello, World” in C, and again in Java, we expect those programs to do exactly the same thing. Likewise, prompt engineers might also expect a prompt that works for DALL-E to behave similarly with Stable Diffusion. Granted, they may be trained on different data and so have different elements in their visual vocabulary, but if we can get DALL-E to draw a Tarsier eating a Cobra in the style of Picasso, shouldn’t we expect the same prompt to do something similar with Stable Diffusion or Midjourney?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In effect, programs like DALL-E are defining something that looks somewhat like a formal programming language. The “formality” of that language doesn’t come from the problem itself, or from the software implementing that language–it’s a natural language model, not a formal language model. Formality derives from the expectations of users. The Midjourney article even talks about “keywords”–sounding like an early manual for programming in BASIC. I’m not arguing that there’s anything good or bad about this–values don’t come into it at all. Users inevitably develop ideas about how things “ought to” behave. And the developers of these tools, if they are to become more than academic playthings, will have to think about users’ expectations on issues like backward compatibility and cross-platform behavior.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That begs the question: what will the developers of programs like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion do? After all, they are already more than academic playthings: they are already used for business purposes (like designing logos), and we already see business models built around them. In addition to charges for using the models themselves, there are already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/29/a-startup-is-charging-1-99-for-strings-of-text-to-feed-to-dall-e-2/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">startups selling prompt strings</a>, a market that assumes that the behavior of prompts is consistent over time. Will the front end of image generators continue to be large language models, capable of parsing just about everything but delivering inconsistent results? (Is inconsistency even a problem for this domain? Once you’ve created a logo, will you ever need to use that prompt again?) Or will the developers of image generators look at the DALL-E Prompt Reference (currently hypothetical, but someone eventually will write it), and realize that they need to implement that specification? If the latter, how will they do it?\\xa0 Will they develop a giant BNF grammar and use compiler-generation tools, leaving out the language model?\\xa0Will they develop a natural language model that’s more constrained, that’s less formal than a formal computing language but more formal than *Semi-Huinty?<sup>1</sup> Might they use a language model to understand words like Tarsier, Picasso, and eating, but treat phrases like “in the style of” more like keywords? The answer to this question will be important: it will be something we really haven’t seen in computing before.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Will the next stage in the development of generative software be the development of informal formal languages?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>*Semi-Huinty is a hypothetical hypothetical language somewhere in the Germanic language family.

These examples of denigration and stereotyping are troubling and harmful, but what happens when the same types of systems are used in more sensitive applications? Leading scientific publications assert that algorithms used in healthcare in the U.S. diverted care away from <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">millions of black people</a>.

These errors can hurt people in very unfair ways. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we use AI in security applications, the risks become even more direct. In security, bias isn’t just offensive and harmful. It’s a weakness that adversaries will exploit. What could happen if a deepfake detector works better on people who look like President Biden than on people who look like former President Obama? What if a named entity recognition (NER) system, based on a cutting-edge large language model (LLM), fails for Chinese, Cyrillic, or Arabic text? The answer is simple—bad things and legal liabilities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As AI technologies are adopted more broadly in security and other high-risk applications, we’ll all need to know more about AI audit and risk management. This article introduces the basics of AI audit, through the lens of our practical experience at <a href=\"https://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a>, a boutique law firm focused on AI risks, and shares some general lessons we’ve learned from auditing sophisticated deepfake detection and LLM systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What Are AI Audits and Assessments?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Audit of decision-making and algorithmic systems is a niche vertical, but not necessarily a new one. Audit has been an integral aspect of model risk management (MRM) in consumer finance for years, and colleagues at <a href=\"https://www.bldsllc.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BLDS</a> and <a href=\"https://quantuniversity.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">QuantUniversity</a> have been conducting model audits for some time. Then there’s the new cadre of AI audit firms like <a href=\"https://orcaarisk.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ORCAA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.getparity.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Parity</a>, and <a href=\"https://babl.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">babl</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a> being the only law firm of the bunch. AI audit firms tend to perform a mix of audits and assessments. Audits are usually more official, tracking adherence to some policy, regulation, or law, and tend to be conducted by independent third parties with varying degrees of limited interaction between auditor and auditee organizations. Assessments tend to be more informal and cooperative. AI audits and assessments may focus on bias issues or other serious risks including <a href=\"https://www.torquenews.com/1083/tesla-model-3-autopilot-hits-yet-another-police-vehicle-why-wont-they-stop\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">safety</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21114358/facebook-550-million-settle-lawsuit-facial-recognition-technology-illinois\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data privacy harms</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53389657\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While standards for AI audits are still immature, they do exist. For our audits, <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a> applies external authoritative standards from laws, regulations, and AI risk management frameworks. For example, we may audit anything from an organization’s adherence to the nascent New York City employment law, to obligations under Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations, to MRM guidelines, to fair lending regulations, or to NIST’s draft AI risk management framework (AI RMF).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From our perspective, regulatory frameworks like MRM present some of the clearest and most mature guidance for audit, which are critical for organizations looking to minimize their legal liabilities. The internal control questionnaire in the <a href=\"https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/model-risk-management/pub-ch-model-risk.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s MRM Handbook</em></a> (starting pg. 84) is an extraordinarily polished and complete audit checklist, and <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107a1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the Interagency Guidance on Model Risk Management</em></a> (also known as SR 11-7) puts forward clear cut advice on audit and the governance structures that are necessary for effective AI risk management writ large. Given that MRM is likely too stuffy and resource-intensive for nonregulated entities to adopt fully today, we can also look to NIST’s <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2022/08/18/AI_RMF_2nd_draft.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>draft AI Risk Management Framework</em></a> and the risk management <a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/AIRMF/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">playbook</a> for a more general AI audit standard. In particular, NIST’s SP1270 <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1270.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Towards a Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias in Artificial Intelligence</em></a>, a resource associated with the draft AI RMF, is extremely useful in bias audits of newer and complex AI systems.<sup>1</sup></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For audit results to be recognized, audits have to be transparent and fair. Using a public, agreed-upon standard for audits is one way to enhance fairness and transparency in the audit process. But what about the auditors? They too must be held to some standard that ensures ethical practices. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a> is held to the Washington, DC, Bar’s <a href=\"https://www.dcbar.org/for-lawyers/legal-ethics/rules-of-professional-conduct\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rules of Professional Conduct</a>. Of course, there are other emerging auditor standards, <a href=\"https://forhumanity.center/forhumanity-university/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">certifications</a>, and principles. Understanding the ethical obligations of your auditors, as well as the existence (or not) of nondisclosure agreements or attorney-client privilege, is a key part of engaging with external auditors. You should also be considering the objective standards for the audit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of what your organization could expect from an AI audit, and for more information on audits and assessments, the recent paper <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44206-022-00017-z.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Algorithmic Bias and Risk Assessments: Lessons from Practice</em></a> is a great resource. If you’re thinking of a less formal internal assessment, the influential <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3351095.3372873\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Closing the AI Accountability Gap</em></a> puts forward a solid framework with worked documentation examples.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What Did We Learn From Auditing a Deepfake Detector and an LLM for Bias?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Being a law firm, <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a> is almost never allowed to discuss our work due to the fact that most of it is privileged and confidential. However, we’ve had the good fortune to work with <a href=\"https://www.iqt.org/labs/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IQT Labs</a> over the past months, and they generously shared summaries of <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a>’s audits. <a href=\"https://www.iqt.org/ai-assurance-do-deepfakes-discriminate/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">One audit</a> addressed potential bias in a deepfake detection system and <a href=\"https://www.iqt.org/interrogating-roberta-inside-the-challenge-of-learning-to-audit-ai-models-and-tools/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the other</a> considered bias in LLMs used for NER tasks. <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a> audited these systems for adherence to the <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.gov/artificial-intelligence-ethics-framework-for-the-intelligence-community\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>AI Ethics Framework for the Intelligence Community</em></a>. We also tend to use standards from US nondiscrimination law and the NIST SP1270 guidance to fill in any gaps around bias measurement or specific LLM concerns. Here’s a brief summary of what we learned to help you think through the basics of audit and risk management when your organization adopts complex AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Bias is about more than data and models</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most people involved with AI understand that unconscious biases and overt prejudices are recorded in digital data. When that data is used to train an AI system, that system can replicate our bad behavior with speed and scale. Unfortunately, that’s just one of many mechanisms by which bias sneaks into AI systems. By definition, new AI technology is less mature. Its operators have less experience and associated governance processes are less fleshed out. In these scenarios, bias has to be approached from a broad social and technical perspective. In addition to data and model problems, decisions in initial meetings, homogenous engineering perspectives, improper design choices, insufficient stakeholder engagement, misinterpretation of results, and other issues can all lead to biased system outcomes. If an audit or other AI risk management control focuses only on tech, it’s not effective.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you’re struggling with the notion that social bias in AI arises from mechanisms besides data and models, consider the concrete example of screenout discrimination. This occurs when those with disabilities are unable to access an employment system, and they lose out on employment opportunities. For screenout, it may not matter if the system’s outcomes are perfectly balanced across demographic groups, when for example, someone can’t see the screen, be understood by voice recognition software, or struggles with typing. In this context, bias is often about system design and not about data or models. Moreover, screenout is a potentially serious <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/americans-disabilities-act-and-use-software-algorithms-and-artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">legal liability</a>. If you’re thinking that deepfakes, LLMs and other advanced AI wouldn’t be used in employment scenarios, sorry, that’s wrong too. Many organizations now perform fuzzy keyword matching and resume scanning based on LLMs. And several new startups are proposing deepfakes as a way to make foreign accents more understandable for customer service and other work interactions that could easily spillover to interviews.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Data labeling is a problem</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a> audited <a href=\"https://github.com/IQTLabs/FakeFinder\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FakeFinder</a> (the deepfake detector), we needed to know demographic information about people in deepfake videos to gauge performance and outcome differences across demographic groups. If plans are not made to collect that kind of information from the people in the videos beforehand, then a tremendous manual data labeling effort is required to generate this information. Race, gender, and other demographics are not straightforward to guess from videos. Worse, in deepfakes, bodies and faces can be from different demographic groups. Each face and body needs a label. For the LLM and NER task, <a href=\"http://www.bnh.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BNH.AI</a>’s audit plan required demographics associated with entities in raw text, and possibly text in multiple languages. While there are many interesting and useful benchmark datasets for testing bias in natural language processing, none provided these types of exhaustive demographic labels.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Quantitative measures of bias are often important for audits and risk management. If your organization wants to measure bias quantitatively, you’ll probably need to test data with demographic labels. The difficulties of attaining these labels should not be underestimated. As newer AI systems consume and generate ever-more complicated types of data, labeling data for training and testing is going to get more complicated too. Despite the possibilities for feedback loops and error propagation, we may end up needing AI to label data for other AI systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also observed organizations claiming that data privacy concerns prevent data collection that would enable bias testing. Generally, this is not a defensible position. If you’re using AI at scale for commercial purposes, consumers have a reasonable expectation that AI systems will protect their privacy <em>and</em> engage in fair business practices. While this balancing act may be extremely difficult, it’s usually possible. For example, large consumer finance organizations have been testing models for bias for years without direct access to demographic data. They often use a process called <a href=\"https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201409_cfpb_report_proxy-methodology.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bayesian-improved surname geocoding</a> (BISG) that infers race from name and ZIP code to comply with nondiscrimination and data minimization obligations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Despite flaws, start with simple metrics and clear thresholds</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIXIuYdnyyk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">many</a> mathematical definitions of bias. More are published all the time. More formulas and measurements are published because the existing definitions are always found to be flawed and simplistic. While new metrics tend to be more sophisticated, they’re often harder to explain and lack agreed-upon thresholds at which values become problematic. Starting an audit with complex risk measures that can’t be explained to stakeholders and without known thresholds can result in confusion, delay, and loss of stakeholder engagement.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a first step in a bias audit, we recommend converting the AI outcome of interest to a binary or a single numeric outcome. Final decision outcomes are often binary, even if the learning mechanism driving the outcome is unsupervised, generative, or otherwise complex. With deepfake detection, a deepfake is detected or not. For NER, known entities are recognized or not. A binary or numeric outcome allows for the application of traditional measures of practical and statistical significance with clear thresholds.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These metrics focus on outcome differences across demographic groups. For example, comparing the rates at which different race groups are identified in deepfakes or the difference in mean raw output scores for men and women. As for formulas, they have names like standardized mean difference (SMD, Cohen’s <em>d</em>), the adverse impact ratio (AIR) and four-fifth’s rule threshold, and basic statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., <em>t</em>-, <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>-, binomial <em>z</em>-, or Fisher’s exact tests). When traditional metrics are aligned to existing laws and regulations, this first pass helps address important legal questions and informs subsequent more sophisticated analyses.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What to Expect Next in AI Audit and Risk Management?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many emerging <a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/dc-bill-ai-algorithms-data\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">municipal</a>, <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/top-10-operational-impacts-of-the-cpra-part-9-the-scope-of-the-anticipated-cpra-regulations/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">state</a>, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2231/text\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">federal</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/what-the-draft-european-union-ai-regulations-mean-for-business\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">international</a> data privacy and AI laws are incorporating audits or related requirements. Authoritative <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/committee/6794475/x/catalogue/p/1/u/1/w/0/d/0\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">standards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">frameworks</a> are also becoming more concrete. Regulators are <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2020/04/using-artificial-intelligence-and-algorithms\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking notice</a> of AI incidents, with the FTC “<a href=\"https://www.protocol.com/policy/ftc-algorithm-destroy-data-privacy\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">disgorging</a>” three algorithms in three years. If today’s AI is as powerful as many claim, none of this should come as a surprise. Regulation and oversight is commonplace for other powerful technologies like aviation or nuclear power. If AI is truly the next big transformative technology, get used to audits and other risk management controls for AI systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Footnotes</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Disclaimer: I am a co-author of that document.</li></ol>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-we-learned-auditing-sophisticated-ai-for-bias/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}, {'title': 'The Collaborative Metaverse', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'The Collaborative Metaverse'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-collaborative-metaverse/'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-collaborative-metaverse/', 'comments': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-collaborative-metaverse/#respond', 'published': 'Wed, 12 Oct 2022 20:01:45 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=12, tm_hour=20, tm_min=1, tm_sec=45, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=285, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Mike Loukides'}], 'author': 'Mike Loukides', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mike Loukides'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Metaverse', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Virtual Reality', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Commentary', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/?p=14750', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'We want to congratulate Dylan Field on his startup Figma, which Adobe recently purchased for $20B.

With Figma, he&#8217;s made the big time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s worth thinking about why Figma has been so successful, and why Adobe was willing to pay so much for it. Since the beginning, Figma has been about collaboration. Yes, it was a great design tool. Yes, it ran completely in the browser, no downloads and installation required. But more than anything else, Figma was a tool for collaboration. That was a goal from the beginning. Collaboration wasn&#8217;t an afterthought; it was baked in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>My thesis about the Metaverse is that it is, above all, about enabling collaboration. VR goggles and AR glasses? Fine, but the Metaverse will fail if it only works for those who want to wear a headset. Crypto? I strongly object to the idea that everything needs to be owned—and that every transaction needs to pay a tax to anonymous middlemen (whether they&#8217;re called miners or stakers). Finally, I think that Facebook/Meta, Microsoft, and others who say that the Metaverse is about &#8220;better meetings” are just plain headed in the wrong direction. I can tell you—anyone in this industry can tell you—that we don&#8217;t need better meetings, we need fewer meetings.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we still need people working together, particularly as more and more of us are working remotely. So the real question facing us is: how do we minimize meetings, while enabling people to work together? Meetings are, after all, a tool for coordinating people, for transferring information in groups, for circulating ideas outside of one-to-one conversations. They’re a tool for collaboration. That&#8217;s precisely what tools like Figma are for: enabling designers to work together on a project conveniently, without conflicting with each other. They&#8217;re about demonstrating designs to managers and other stakeholders. They&#8217;re about brainstorming new ideas (with Figjam) with your team members. And they&#8217;re about doing all this without requiring people to get together in a conference room, in Zoom, or in any of the other conferencing services. The problem with those tools isn&#8217;t really the flat screen, the &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8221; design, or the absence of avatars; the problem is that you still have to interrupt some number of people and get them in the same (virtual) place at the same time, breaking whatever flow that they were in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We don&#8217;t need better meetings; we need better tools for collaboration so that we don&#8217;t need as many meetings. That&#8217;s what the Metaverse means for businesses. Tools like GitHub and Google’s Colab are really about collaboration, as are Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365. The Metaverse is strongly associated with gaming, and if you look at games like Overwatch and Fortnite, and you&#8217;ll see that those games are really about collaboration between online players. That&#8217;s what makes these games fun. I&#8217;ve got nothing against VR goggles, but what makes the experience special is the interaction with other players in real time. You don’t need goggles for that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Collaboration made Figma worth $20B. It&#8217;s one of the first &#8220;enterprise Metaverse&#8221; applications.

As a trend, it’s not performing well on Google; it shows little long-term growth, if any, and gets nowhere near as many searches as terms like “Observability” and “Generative Adversarial Networks.” And it’s never bubbled up far enough into our consciousness to make it into our monthly Trends piece. As a trend, we’re openly skeptical about Hyperautomation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, that skeptical conclusion is too simplistic. Hyperautomation may just be another ploy in the game of buzzword bingo, but we need to look behind the game to discover what’s important. There seems to be broad agreement that hyperautomation is the combination of Robotic Process Automation with AI. Natural language generation and natural language understanding are frequently mentioned, too, but they’re subsumed under AI. So is optical character recognition (OCR)–something that’s old hat now, but is one of the first successful applications of AI. Using AI to discover tasks that can be automated also comes up frequently. While we don’t find the multiplication of buzzwords endearing, it’s hard to argue that adding AI to anything is uninteresting–and specifically adding AI to automation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s also hard to argue against the idea that we’ll see more automation in the future than we see now.&nbsp; We’ll see it in the processing of the thousands of documents businesses handle every day. We’ll see it in customer service. We’ll see it in compliance. We’ll see it in healthcare. We’ll see it in banking. Several years ago, the “Automate all the things!” meme originated in IT’s transformation from manual system administration to automated configuration management and software deployment. That may be the first instance of what’s now been christened Hyperautomation. We can certainly apply the slogan to many, if not all, clerical tasks–and even to the automation process itself. “Automate all the things” is itself a thing. And yes, the meme was always partially ironic–so we should be on the lookout for promises that are easily made but hard to keep.&nbsp;Some tasks should not be automated; some tasks could be automated, but the company has insufficient data to do a good job; some tasks can be automated easily, but would benefit from being redesigned first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So we’re skeptical about the term Hyperautomation, but we’re not skeptical about the desire to automate. A new buzzword may put automation on executives’ radar–or it may be little more than a technique for rebranding older products. The difference is focusing on your business needs, rather than the sales pitch. Automating routine office tasks is an important and worthwhile project–and redesigning routine tasks so that they can be integrated into a larger workflow that can be automated more effectively is even more important. Setting aside the buzzword, we can start by asking what a successful automation project requires. In the long run, the buzzword is unimportant; getting the job done is what matters.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Automating Office Processes</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s easy to observe that in most companies, there are many processes that can be automated but aren’t. Processing invoices, managing inventory, customer service, handling loan applications, taking orders, billing customers: these are all processes that are largely routine and open to automation. At some companies, these tasks are already automated, at least in part. But I don’t want to trivialize the thinking that goes into automating a process. What’s required?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Office staff usually perform tasks like invoice processing by filling in a web form. Automating this process is simple. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Selenium</a>, the first tool for automated browser testing (2004), could be programmed to find fields on a web page, click on them or insert text, click “submit,” scrape the resulting web page, and collect results. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Robotic process automation</a> (RPA) has a fancier name, but that’s really all it is. This kind of automation predates modern AI. It’s purely rules-based: click here, add a name there, use some fairly simple logic to fill in the other fields, and click submit. It’s possible to augment this basic process with OCR so the application can find data on paper forms, or to use natural language processing to gather information through a chat server. But the core of the process is simple, and hasn’t changed much since the early days of web testing. We could see it as an example of 1980s-style “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expert systems</a>,” based on deterministic business rules.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That simple scenario doesn’t hold up for more complex tasks. Consider an application for filling a prescription at a pharmacy. That application has to:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>look up when the prescription was last filled</li><li>look up patient data to see whether there are any refills left</li><li>look up the prescriber and generate a message, if there are no refills left</li><li>look up the patient’s other medications to determine whether there are any drug interactions</li><li>look up regulations about restricted substances, in which case other rules apply (for example, requiring ID when the patient picks up the medication)</li><li>look up the pharmacy’s stock to see whether the medication is in stock (and order it if it isn’t)</li><li>look up the patient’s insurance to generate charges for the insurance company&nbsp;</li><li>look up the patient’s credit card information to generate a charge for the co-pay</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are probably even more steps (I am not a pharmacist) and variations: new prescriptions, expired prescriptions, uninsured patients, expired credit cards, and no doubt many more corner cases. None of these steps is particularly difficult by itself, and each could be viewed as a separate task for automation, giving you a web of interconnected tasks–more complex, but not necessarily a bad result. However, one thing should be obvious: to fill a prescription, you need to access many different kinds of data, in many different databases. Some of these data sources will be owned by the pharmacy; others aren’t. Most are subject to privacy regulations. They are all likely to exist in some kind of silo that’s difficult to access from the outside the group that created the silo–and the reason for that difficulty may be political as well as technological.&nbsp;So from the start, we have a data integration problem compounded with a compliance problem. Data integration and regulatory compliance are particularly tough in healthcare and medicine, but don’t kid yourself: if you’re working with data, you will face integration problems, and if you’re working with personal data, you need to think about compliance. An AI project that doesn’t address data integration and governance (including compliance) is bound to fail, regardless of how good your AI technology might be. Buzzword or not, Hyperautomation is doing a service if it focuses attention on these issues.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data integration problems aren’t pretty; they’re boring, uninteresting, the “killing field of any modeling project,” as Lorien Pratt has said. So we really can’t talk about automating any significant task without seeing it as a non-trivial data integration project: matching IDs, reconciling slightly different definitions of database columns, de-duping, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">named entity recognition</a>, all of that fun stuff. Some of these tasks have been automated, but many aren’t. <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/why-its-time-data-centric-artificial-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Ng</a>, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/artificial-intelligence-conference/9781492050544/9781492050544-video324795/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Ré</a>, and others have pointed out that in the past decade, we’ve made a lot of progress with algorithms and hardware for running AI. Our current set of AI algorithms are good enough, as is our hardware; the hard problems are all about data. That’s the cutting edge for AI research: automating ways to find quality data, clean it, label it, and merge it with data from other sources. While that research is only starting to filter into practice, and much remains to be done, “automating all the things” will require confronting data problems from the beginning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another sad reality is that a company’s data is less rich than they’d like to think. We don’t need to look any further than O’Reilly for an example. Like any online company, we have good visibility into what happens on the <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/home/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">O’Reilly Learning Platform</a>. We can see what books and courses our customers are using, and for how long. We know if customers only read the first chapter of some book, and can think about what how to improve it. The data available to our retail business is much more limited. We know we’ve sold X books to Amazon, and Y books to wholesalers, but we never know anything about the customers who buy those books, when they buy them, or even if they buy them. Books can sit on shelves or in warehouses for a long time before they come back as returns. The online business is information-rich; the retail business is information-poor. Most real-world business lie somewhere between those extremes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That’s the bad news. The good news is that we’re talking about building something exciting. We’re talking about applications that use APIs to pull data from many different sources, and deliver better results than humans can. We’re talking about applications that integrate all of those sources into a single course of action, and can do so seamlessly. There are resonances between this and what, in other application domains, is being called a “metaverse.” While we’re skeptical about how the term “Hyperautomation” has been used, we also wonder: is Hyperautomation, considered properly, the business version of the metaverse? One component of a business metaverse would certainly be seamless access to data wherever it resides; the metaverse would be populated by bots that automate routine tasks. Hold that thought; we’ll return to it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Making Good Business Decisions</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finding processes to automate is called process discovery. We have to be careful about process discovery because automating the wrong processes, or automating them in inappropriate ways, wastes resources at best; at worst, it can make a business uncompetitive. There are products that use AI to discover which processes can be automated, but in real life, process discovery will rely heavily on people: your knowledge of the business, the knowledge of subject matter experts, and the knowledge of staff members who are actually doing the work, and whose input is often ignored.&nbsp; I’m reminded of a friend who was hired to build a new application to check in patients at a doctor’s office. The receptionists hated the old app. No one knew why, until my friend insisted on sitting down at the receptionist’s desk. Then it was painfully obvious why the staff hated the old application–and the problem was easy to correct.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Over the past decade, one problem with data science and its successors has been the assumption that all you need is data, and lots of it; analyzing that data will lead you to new products, new processes, new strategies: just follow the data and let it transform your business. But we also know that <a href=\"https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639028/why-ai-investments-fail-to-deliver.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">most AI projects fail</a>, just as <a href=\"https://www.cio.com/article/230427/why-it-projects-still-fail.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">most IT projects fail</a>. If you don’t want your projects to be among the failures, you can’t make naive assumptions about what data can do. All businesses like “up and to the right,” and data is good at revealing trends that look “up and to the right.” However, growth always ends: nothing grows exponentially forever, not even Facebook and Google. You’ll eventually run out of potential new customers, raw material, credit at the bank–something will get in the way. The historical trends revealed by data will eventually end. Data isn’t very good at telling you where the growth curve will flatten out, and for an executive, that’s probably the most important information. What will cause those trends to end, and what strategies will the business need to adopt? It is difficult to answer that kind of question with nothing but data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Lorien Pratt outlines a four-step process for using data effectively to make business decisions:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Understand the business outcomes that you want to achieve.</li><li>Understand the actions that you can take in your current business situation.</li><li>Map out the paths between actions and outcomes. If you take some action, what changes? Most actions have multiple effects.&nbsp;</li><li>Decide where data fits in. What data do you have? How can you use it to analyze your current situation, and measure the results of any actions you take?</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These four steps are the heart of <a href=\"https://www.lorienpratt.com/dihandbook/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decision intelligence</a>. It is a good process for any business decision, but it’s particularly important when you’re implementing automation. If you start from the data, rather than the business outcomes and the levers you can use to change the situation, you are likely to miss important possibilities. No dataset tells you the structure of the world; that requires human expertise and experience. You’ll find small, local optimizations, but you’re likely to miss important use cases if you don’t look at the larger picture. This leads to a “knowledge decision gap.” Pratt mentions the use of satellite imagery to analyze data relevant to climate change: predicting fires, floods, and other events. The models exist, and are potentially very useful; but on the ground, firefighters and others who respond to emergencies still use paper maps. They don&#8217;t have access to up to date maps and forecasts, which can show what roads can be used safely, and where severe damage has occurred. Data needs to become the means, a tool for making good decisions. It is not an end in itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Donald Farmer says something similar. It’s easy to look at some process (for example, invoice processing, or checking in patients) and decide to automate it. You analyze what your staff does to process an invoice, and then design a system to perform that process. You may use some process discovery tools to help. If the process you are automating requires making some simple decisions, AI can probably be used to automate those decisions. You will probably succeed, but this approach overlooks two big problems. First, many business processes are failing processes. They’re inefficient, poorly designed, and perhaps even wholly inappropriate for the task. Never assume that most businesses are well run, and that they represent some sort of “best practice.” If you automate a poor process, then all you have is a faster poor process. That may be an improvement, but even if it’s an improvement, it’s sure to be far from optimal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Farmer’s second point is related, but goes much deeper. Business processes never exist in isolation. They connect to other processes in a complex web. That web of connected processes is really what makes the business work. Invoice processing has tendrils into accounting. Manufacturing affects quality control, customer support, finance, shipping and receiving, accounts receivable, and more. HR processes have effects throughout the organization. Redesigning one process might give you a local improvement, but rethinking how the business works is a much bigger opportunity.&nbsp; Farmer points to <a href=\"https://www.blackline.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blackline</a>, a company that does process automation for financial services. They don’t automate a single process: they automate all of a client’s financial processes, with the result that all actions are processed immediately; the books are always closed. This kind of automation has huge consequences. You don’t have to wait for a few weeks after the end of a month (or quarter or year) to close the books and find out your results; you know the results continuously. As a result, your relationship to many important financial metrics changes. You always know your cash flow; you always know your credit line. Audits take on a completely different meaning because the business is always auditing itself. New strategies are possible because you have information that you’ve never had before.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Other areas of a company could be treated similarly. What would supply chain management be like if a company had constant, up-to-date information about inventory, manufacturing, new orders, and shipping? What would happen to product design, sales, and engineering if a constant digest of issues from customer service were available to them?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These changes sound like something that we’ve often talked about in software development: continuous integration and continuous delivery. Just as CI/CD requires IT departments to automate software deployment pipelines, continuous business processes come from automating–together–all of the processes that make businesses work. Rethinking the entirety of a business’s processes in order to gain new insights about the nature of the business, to change your relationship to critical measures like cash flow, and to automate the business’s core to make it more effective is indeed Hyperautomation. It’s all about integrating processes that couldn’t be integrated back when the processes were done by hand; that pattern recurs repeatedly as businesses transform themselves into digital businesses. Again, does this sound like a business Metaverse? After all, the consumer Metaverse is all about <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-metaverse-is-not-a-place/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sharing immersive experience</a>. While automating business processes doesn’t require VR goggles, for an executive I can’t imagine anything more immersive than immediate, accurate knowledge of every aspect of a company’s business. That’s surely more important than taking a meeting with your bank’s 3D avatars.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This kind of automation doesn’t come from a superficial application of AI to some isolated business tasks. It’s all about deep integration of technology, people, and processes. Integration starts with a thorough understanding of a business’s goals, continues with an understanding of the actions you can take to change your situations, and ends with the development of data-driven tools to effect the changes you want to see. While AI tools can help discover processes that can be automated, AI tools can’t do this job alone. It can’t happen without subject matter experts. It requires collaboration between people who know your business well, the people who are actually performing those tasks, and the stakeholders–none of which have the entire picture. Nor can it be undertaken without addressing data integration problems head-on. For some problems, like pharmacy prescription application we’ve already touched on, data integration isn’t just another problem; it is the problem that dwarfs all other problems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also need to be aware of the dangers. On one hand, automating all of a company’s processes to make a single coherent whole sounds like a great idea. On the other hand, it sounds like the kind of massive boil-the-ocean IT project that’s almost certainly bound to fail, or remain forever unfinished. Is there a happy medium between automating a single process and embarking on an endless task? There has to be. Understand your business’s goals, understand what levers can affect your performance, understand where you can use data–and then start with a single process, but a process that you have understood in the broader context.&nbsp;Then don’t just build applications. Build services, and applications that work by using those services. Build an API that can integrate with other processes that you automate.&nbsp;When you build services, you make it easier to automate your other tasks, including tasks that involve customers and suppliers. This is how <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Bezos built</a> Amazon’s business empire.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The Humans in the Loop</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Developers who are automating business systems have to determine where humans belong in the loop. This is a sensitive issue: many employees will be afraid of losing their jobs, being “replaced by a machine.” Despite talk about making jobs more interesting and challenging, it would be unrealistic to deny that many executives look at process automation and think about reducing headcount. Employees’ fears are real. Still, as of mid-2022, we remain in a job market where hiring is difficult, at any level, and if a business is going to grow, it needs the human resources to grow. Automating processes to make decisions in routine situations can be a way to do more without adding staff: if pharmacy employees can rely on an automated process to look up drug interactions, regulations, and medical records, in addition to managing the insurance process, they are free to take on more important or more difficult tasks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Making jobs more challenging (or difficult) can be a double-edged sword. While many people in the automation industry talk about “relieving staff of boring, routine tasks,” they often aren’t familiar with the realities of clerical work. Boring, routine tasks are indeed boring and routine, but few people want to spend all their time wrestling with difficult, complex tasks. Everybody likes an “easy win,” and few people want an environment where they’re constantly challenged and facing difficulties–if nothing else, they’ll end up approaching every new task when they’re tired and mentally exhausted. Tired and overstressed employees are less likely to make good decisions, and more likely to think “what’s the easiest way to get this decision off of my desk.” The question of how to balance employees’ work experiences, giving them both the “easy wins,” but enabling them to handle the more challenging cases hasn’t been resolved. We haven’t seen an answer to this question–for the time, it’s important to recognize that it’s a real issue that can’t be ignored.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s also very easy to talk about “human in the loop” without talking about where, exactly, the human fits in the loop. Designing the loop needs to be part of the automation plan. Do we want humans evaluating and approving all the AI system’s decisions?&nbsp; That begs the question of exactly what, or why, we’re automating. That kind of loop might be somewhat more efficient, because software would look up information and fill in forms automatically. But the gain in efficiency would be relatively small. Even if they didn’t need to spend time looking up information, an office worker would still need to understand each case. We want systems that implement end-to-end automation, as much as possible. We need employees to remain in the loop, but their role may not be making individual decisions. Human employees need to monitor the system’s behavior to ensure that it is working effectively. For some decisions, AI may only play an advisory role: a human may use AI to run a number of simulations, look at possible outcomes, and then make set a policy or execute some action. Humans aren’t managed by the machine; it’s the other way around. Humans need to understand the context of decisions, and improve the system’s ability to make good decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we want to leave as many decisions as possible to the system, what roles do we want humans to have? Why do we want humans in the loop? What should they be doing?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Humans need to manage and improve the system</li><li>Humans need to investigate and rectify bad decisions</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Neither role is trivial or simple. “Managing and improving the system” encompasses a lot, ranging from automating new tasks to improving the system’s performance on current tasks. All AI models have a finite lifetime; at some point, their behavior won’t reflect the “real world,” possibly because the system itself has changed the way the real world behaves. Models are also subject to bias; they are built from historical data, and historical data almost never reflects our ideals of fairness and justice.&nbsp; Therefore, managing and improving the system includes careful monitoring, understanding and evaluating data sources, and handling the data integration problems that result. We’re talking about a job that’s much more technical than a typical clerical position.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This understanding of the “human in the loop” suggests a user interface that’s more like a dashboard than a web form. People in this role will&nbsp; need to know how the system is operating on many levels, ranging from basic performance (which could be measured in actions per second, time taken to generate and communicate an action), to aggregate statistics about decisions (how many users are clicking on recommended products), to real-time auditing of the quality of the decisions (are they fair or biased, and if biased, in what way).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Likewise, all decision-making processes are going to produce bad decisions from time to time.&nbsp;For better or for worse, that’s baked into the foundations of AI. (And as humans, we can’t claim that we don’t also make bad decisions.) Those bad decisions will range from simple misdiagnoses, poor recommendations, and errors to subtle examples of bias. We can’t make the mistake of assuming that an automated decision will always be correct. It’s possible that automated decision-making will be&nbsp; an improvement over human decision-making; but bad decisions will still be made. The good news is that, at least in principle, AI systems are auditable. We know exactly what decisions were made, we know the data that the system used.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can also ask an AI system to explain itself, although explainability is still an area of active research. We need explanations for two reasons. Staff will need to explain decisions to customers: people have never liked the feeling that they are interacting with a machine, and while that preference might change, “that’s what the computer said” will never be a satisfactory explanation. The system’s explanation of its decisions needs to be concise and intelligible. Saying that a loan applicant was on the wrong side of some abstract boundary in a high-dimensional space won’t do it; a list of three or four factors that affected the decision will satisfy many users. A loan applicant needs to know that they don’t have sufficient income, that they have a poor credit history, or that the item they want to purchase is overpriced. Once that reasoning is on the table, it’s possible to move forward and ask whether the automated system was incorrect, and from there, to change the decision. We can’t let automation become another way for management to “blame the computer” and avoid accountability.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Improving the system so that it gives better results requires a more technical explanation. Is the system too sensitive to certain factors? Was it trained using biased, unfair data? Is it inferring qualities like gender or ethnicity from other data? Relatively simple tests, like higher error rates for minority groups, are often a sign of bias. Data is always historical, and history doesn’t score very well on fairness. Fairness is almost always aspirational: something we want to characterize the decisions we’re making now and in the future. Generating fair results from biased data is still a subject for research, but again, we have an important advantage: decisions made by machines are auditable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To override an automated decision, we need to consider interfaces for performing two different tasks: correcting the action, and preventing the incorrect action from being taken again. The first might be a simple web form that overrides the original decision–no matter how hard we try to automate “simple web forms” out of existence, they have a way of returning. The second needs to feed back into the metrics and dashboards for monitoring the system’s behavior. Is retraining needed? Is special-purpose training to fine-tune a model’s behavior an option?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although re-training an AI system can be expensive, and auditing training data is a big project, they’re necessary, and have to be part of the plan. Even when there are no egregious errors, models need to be retrained to remain relevant. For example, fashion recommendations from a model that hasn’t been retrained in a year are not likely to be relevant.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another problem with interfaces between humans and AI systems arises when we position the system as an “oracle”: a voice of truth that provides “the right answer.” We haven’t yet developed user interfaces that allow users to discuss or argue with a computer; users can’t question authority.&nbsp; (Such interfaces might grow out of the work on large language models that’s being done by Google, Facebook, OpenAI, HuggingFace, and others.) Think about a diagnostic system in a doctor’s office. The system might look at a photo of a patient’s rash and say “That’s poison ivy.” So can a doctor or a nurse, and they’re likely to say “I didn’t need an expensive machine to tell me that,” even if the machine allows them to treat more patients in an hour. But there’s a deeper problem: what happens if that diagnosis (whether human or automated) is wrong? What if, after treatment, the patient returns with the same rash? You can’t give the same diagnosis again.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shortly after IBM’s Watson won Jeopardy, I was invited to a demonstration at their lab. It included a short game (played against IBM employees), but what interested me the most was when they showed what happened when Watson gave an incorrect answer. They showed the last five alternatives, from which Watson chose its answer. This level wasn’t just a list: it included pros and cons for each answer under consideration, along with the estimated probability that each answer was correct. Choose the highest probability and you have an “oracle.” But if the oracle is wrong, the most useful information will be on the layer with the rejected answers: the other answers that might have been correct. That information could help the doctor whose patient returns because their poison ivy was actually a strange food allergy: a list of other possibilities, along with questions to ask that might lead to a resolution. Our insistence on AI systems as oracles, rather than knowledgeable assistants, has prevented us from developing user interfaces that support collaboration and exploration between a computer and a human.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Automation isn’t about replacing humans; it’s about collaboration between humans and machines. One important area of research for the “office metaverse” will be rethinking user interface designs for AI systems. We will need better dashboards for monitoring the performance of our automation systems; we’ll need interfaces that help workers research and explore ambiguous areas; and we probably won’t get away from filling in web forms, though if automation can handle all the simple cases, that may be all right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Hyperautomation may or may not be the biggest technology trend of 2022. That game of buzzword bingo is unimportant. But “automating all the things”–that’s sure to be on every senior manager’s mind. As you head in this direction, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Businesses are complex systems. While you should start with some simple automation tasks, remember that these simple tasks are components of these larger systems. Don’t just automate poor processes; take the opportunity to understand what you are doing and why you are doing it, and redesign your business accordingly.</li><li>Humans must always be in the loop. Their (our) primary role shouldn’t be to accept or reject automated decisions, but to understand where the system is succeeding and failing, and to help it to improve.&nbsp;</li><li>The most important function of the “human in the loop” is accountability. If a machine makes a bad decision, who is accountable and who has the authority to rectify it?</li><li>Answers and decisions don’t arise magically out of the data. Start by understanding the business problems you are trying to solve, the actions that will have an influence on those problems, and then look at the data you can bring to bear.</li><li>Companies marketing AI solutions focus on the technology.&nbsp; But the technology is useless without good data–and most businesses aren’t as data-rich as they think they are. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you keep these ideas in mind, you’ll be in good shape. AI isn’t magic. Automation isn’t magic. They’re tools, means to an end–but that end can be reinventing your business. The industry has talked about digital transformation for a long time, but few companies have really done it. This is your opportunity to start.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Special thanks to Jennifer Stirrup, Lorien Pratt, and Donald Farmer, for conversations about Hyperautomation, Decision Intelligence, and automating business decisions.&nbsp;Without them, this article wouldn’t have been possible.

We have some ideas–I’ve suggested that intelligence and consciousness are deeply connected to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/intelligence-and-comprehension/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the ability to disobey</a>, and others have suggested that intelligence can’t exist outside of embodiment (some sort of connection between the intelligence and the physical world). But we really don’t have a definition. We have a lot of partial definitions, all of which are bound to specific contexts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, we often say that dogs are intelligent. But what do we mean by that? Some dogs, like sheep dogs, are very good at performing certain tasks. Most dogs can be trained to sit, fetch, and do other things. And they can disobey. The same is true of children, though we’d never compare a child’s intelligence to a dog’s. And cats won’t do any of those things, though we never refer to cats as unintelligent.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m very impressed with <a href=\"https://alexfoundation.org/about/dr-irene-pepperberg/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Irene Pepperberg’s work on parrot intelligence</a>. She’s shown that her parrots can have an understanding of numbers, can use language intelligently, and can even invent new vocabulary. (“Banerry” for apple, probably because birds don’t have lips and can’t say Ps very well. And apples look like giant cherries and taste like bananas, at least to parrots.) But I wonder if even this is getting the question wrong. (I think Dr. Pepperberg would agree.) We ask birds to be intelligent about things humans are intelligent about. We never ask humans to be intelligent about things birds are intelligent about: navigating in three-dimensional space, storing food for use during winter (a boreal chickadee will <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2019/chickadee-memory-food\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">store as many as 80,000 seeds</a> in different places, and remember where they’re all located), making use of the many colors birds see that we can’t (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/10/854/233996\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">their vision extends well into the ultraviolet</a>). It’s easy to imagine a bird thinking, “Those poor humans. They can’t find their home without taking out that strange little black box (which is actually colored octarine).”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a similar vein, we often say that dolphins and elephants are intelligent, but it’s never clear what exactly we mean by that. We’ve demonstrated that dolphins can recognize patterns and that they recognize themselves in mirrors, and they’ve demonstrated a (limited) ability to communicate with humans, but their intelligence certainly goes much further. I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if animals like dolphins had an oral literature. We penalize them on the intelligence scale because they don’t have hands and can’t pick up a pen. Likewise, some research shows that <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120803103421.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">elephants communicate</a> with each other using low frequency rumbles that can be heard for miles (if you’re an elephant). Information theory suggests that this communication can’t be fast, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be rich.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Humans are intelligent. After all, we get to define what “intelligence” means. Controlling the definition of intelligence has always been a source of cultural and political power; just read anything written in America in the 19th century about the intelligence of women, Asians, Africans, or even the Irish and Italians. We have “intelligence tests” to measure intelligence–or do they just measure test-taking ability? We also talk about “emotional” and other kinds of intelligence. And we recognize that mathematical, linguistic, and artistic ability rarely go hand-in-hand. Our own view of our own intelligence is highly fractured, and often has more to do with pseudo-science than anything we could use as a metric in machine learning experiments. (Though GPT-3 and LaMDA are no doubt very good at taking tests.) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, there’s also been a lot of talk recently about the possibility of discovering life on other planets. Life is one thing, and my decidedly amateur opinion is that we will find life fairly common. However, to discover intelligent life, we would need a working definition of intelligence. The only useful definition I can imagine is “able to generate signals that can be received off planet and that are indisputably non-natural.” But by that definition, humans have only been intelligent for roughly 100 years, since the early days of radio. (I’m not convinced that the early electrical experiments from the 19th century and spark-based radio from the first two decades of the 20th century could be detected off planet.) There may be fantastically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intelligent creatures living under the ice covering Saturn’s moon Titan</a>, but we’ll never be able to detect them without going there. For Titan, a visit may be possible. For planets elsewhere in our galaxy, probably not.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even more important: these definitions aren’t just different. They’re different in kind. We’re not saying that a parrot or a crow is intelligent if it scores 0.3 (on a scale of 0 to 1) on some test, but an autonomous vehicle has to score .99. The definitions aren’t remotely comparable. I don’t know what it would mean to ask GPT-3 about soaring on air currents. If we asked, we would get an answer, and quite likely a good one with a lot of information about aerodynamics, but would that have anything to do with an eagle’s understanding of flight? I could tell Gato to “sit,” but how would I know if it complied?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what does this tell us about intelligence that’s artificial? Context is important; an appropriate definition of “intelligence” has to start with what we want the system to do. In some cases, that’s generating publishable papers and good PR. With natural language systems like GPT-3, we tend to ignore the fact that you often have to try several prompts to produce reasonable output. (Would we consider a human intelligent if they had to try 5 times to answer a question?) As has often been noted, systems like GPT-3 often get basic facts wrong. But humans often respond to prompts incoherently, and we frequently get our facts wrong.&nbsp; We get things wrong in different ways, and for different reasons; investigating those differences might reveal something about how our intelligence works, and might lead us to a better understanding of what an “artificial intelligence” might mean.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But without that investigation, our standard for intelligence is fairly loose. An AI system for making product recommendations can be successful even if most of the recommendations are wrong–just look at Amazon. (I’m not being ironic. If there are 10 recommendations and you’re interested in one of them, Amazon has won.) An AI system for an autonomous vehicle has to work to a much higher standard. So do many systems where safety isn’t an issue. We could happily talk about the “intelligence” of an AI chess engine that can beat the average human player, but a chess playing product that can only beat the average human and couldn’t play on a world championship level would be an embarrassment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Which is just to say that intelligence, especially of the artificial sort, is many things. If you read <a href=\"https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Turing’s paper on the Imitation Game</a>, you’ll see quickly that Turing is more interested in the quality of the interaction than the correctness of the result. In his examples, the machine says that it’s not good at writing poetry; hesitates before giving answers; and even gets some results wrong. Turing’s thought experiment is more about whether a machine can behave like a human than about whether it can master many different disciplines. The word “intelligence” only appears once in the body of the paper, and then it refers to a human experimenter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That leads me to a conclusion: Intelligence doesn’t have any single definition, and shouldn’t. Intelligence is always specific to the application.&nbsp; Intelligence for a search engine isn’t the same as intelligence for an autonomous vehicle, isn’t the same as intelligence for a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vsbb9JW05w\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">robotic bird</a>, isn’t the same as intelligence for a language model. And it certainly isn’t the same as the intelligence for humans or for our unknown colleagues on other planets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If that’s true, then why are we talking about “general intelligence” at all?&nbsp; General intelligence assumes a single definition. Discarding the idea of a single unifying definition of “intelligence” doesn’t cost us much, and gains a lot: we are free to create definitions of “intelligence” that are appropriate to specific projects. When embarking on a new project, it’s always helpful to know exactly what you’re trying to achieve. This is great for practical, real-world engineering. And even big, expensive research projects like DALL-E, Gato, LaMDA, and GPT-3 are ultimately engineering projects. If you look beyond the link-bait claims about general intelligence, sentience, and the like, the computer scientists working on these projects are working against well-defined benchmarks. Whether these benchmarks have anything to do with “intelligence” isn’t relevant. They aren’t trying to create an artificial human, or even an artificial dog. (We’ll leave artificial dogs to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Dynamics\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Dynamics</a>.) They are trying–with considerable success–to extend the range of what computers can do. A model that can work successfully in over 600 different contexts is an important achievement. Whether or not that’s “general intelligence” (or intelligence at all) is a side show we don’t need.</p>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-problem-with-intelligence/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0'}], 'feed': {'title': 'Radar', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Radar'}, 'links': [{'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar/feed/', 'rel': 'self', 'type': 'application/rss+xml'}, {'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar'}], 'link': 'https://www.oreilly.com/radar', 'subtitle': 'Now, next, and beyond: Tracking need-to-know trends at the intersection of business and technology', 'subtitle_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Now, next, and beyond: Tracking need-to-know trends at the intersection of business and technology'}, 'updated': 'Wed, 01 Feb 2023 21:08:59 +0000', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2023, tm_mon=2, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=21, tm_min=8, tm_sec=59, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=32, tm_isdst=0), 'language': 'en-US', 'sy_updateperiod': 'hourly', 'sy_updatefrequency': '1', 'generator_detail': {'name': 'https://wordpress.org/?v=5.3.14'}, 'generator': 'https://wordpress.org/?v=5.3.14'}, 'headers': {'content-type': 'text/xml; charset=utf-8', 'feedburnerv2': '', 'last-modified': 'Wed, 1 Feb 2023 23:12:57 GMT', 'cache-control': 'no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate', 'pragma': 'no-cache', 'expires': 'Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT', 'date': 'Tue, 07 Feb 2023 14:19:37 GMT', 'cross-origin-opener-policy': 'same-origin', 'permissions-policy': 'ch-ua-arch=*, ch-ua-bitness=*, ch-ua-full-version=*, ch-ua-full-version-list=*, ch-ua-model=*, ch-ua-wow64=*, ch-ua-platform=*, ch-ua-platform-version=*', 'accept-ch': 'Sec-CH-UA-Arch, Sec-CH-UA-Bitness, Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version, Sec-CH-UA-Full-Version-List, Sec-CH-UA-Model, Sec-CH-UA-WoW64, Sec-CH-UA-Platform, Sec-CH-UA-Platform-Version', 'content-security-policy': \"script-src 'report-sample' 'nonce-qJZ1S2l3r8ibOkHZQ1Y52w' 'unsafe-inline';object-src 'none';base-uri 'self';report-uri /_/RaichuFeedServer/cspreport;worker-src 'self'\", 'cross-origin-resource-policy': 'same-site', 'server': 'ESF', 'x-xss-protection': '0', 'x-frame-options': 'SAMEORIGIN', 'x-content-type-options': 'nosniff', 'accept-ranges': 'none', 'vary': 'Sec-Fetch-Dest, Sec-Fetch-Mode, Sec-Fetch-Site,Accept-Encoding', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked'}, 'updated': 'Wed, 1 Feb 2023 23:12:57 GMT', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2023, tm_mon=2, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=23, tm_min=12, tm_sec=57, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=32, tm_isdst=0), 'href': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'status': 200, 'encoding': 'utf-8', 'version': 'rss20', 'namespaces': {'content': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/', 'wfw': 'http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/', 'dc': 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/', '': 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom', 'sy': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/', 'slash': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/'}}\n"
